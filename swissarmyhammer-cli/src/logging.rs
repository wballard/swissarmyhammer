/// A thread-safe writer wrapper that ensures immediate flushing and disk synchronization for MCP logging.
///
/// This struct wraps a `File` in `Arc<Mutex<>>` to provide thread-safe access while ensuring
/// that all writes are immediately flushed to the operating system and synced to disk.
/// This behavior is critical for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers where log data must
/// be immediately available for debugging purposes.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Multiple threads can safely write to the same `FileWriterGuard` instance. Each write
/// operation acquires the mutex lock, writes the data, flushes the OS buffer, and
/// synchronizes to disk before releasing the lock.
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// This implementation prioritizes data reliability over performance by calling `sync_all()`
/// on every write operation. This ensures data is written to disk immediately but may
/// impact performance in high-throughput scenarios.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
/// use std::fs::File;
/// use swissarmyhammer_cli::logging::FileWriterGuard;
///
/// let file = File::create("log.txt").unwrap();
/// let shared_file = Arc::new(Mutex::new(file));
/// let mut guard = FileWriterGuard::new(shared_file);
///
/// // This write will be immediately flushed and synced to disk
/// guard.write_all(b"Log message\n").unwrap();
/// ```
