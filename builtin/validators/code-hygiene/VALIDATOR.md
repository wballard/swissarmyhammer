# Code Hygiene

## Hardcoded values: two rules, one concern each

`data-driven` and `magic-numbers` split what one rule used to hold.

- `data-driven` owns the **shape**: a `match`/`switch` or `if`/`else if` chain over
  a known set whose arms differ only in constants is a table written out longhand.
  Reading the arms and deciding they differ only in constants is a judgment no
  tool makes, so no tool rule supersedes it.
- `magic-numbers` owns the **name**: a literal repeated across sites, or a shared
  configuration value, needs one constant. Five tool rules supersede it, each for
  the languages a linter can decide — `magic-numbers-python` (ruff `PLR2004`),
  `magic-numbers-typescript` (eslint `no-magic-numbers`), `magic-numbers-go`
  (`mnd`), `magic-numbers-swift` (swiftlint `no_magic_numbers`), and
  `magic-numbers-dart` (solid_lints `no_magic_number`).

Rust keeps the `magic-numbers` prompt rule; the survey below states why. Dart no
longer keeps it: the earlier verdict — that the Dart check needs a `custom_lint`
package, which is a dependency of the project under review — is **reversed**
below.

A tool reports by position and the prompt rule reports by repetition, so a tool
rule reports the one-off literal the prompt rule carves out. Each tool rule's own
file states the measurement behind its thresholds.

### The magic-number survey for Rust and Dart

Two languages had no rule, and neither had an obvious stock lint, so the whole
tool space was read for each before the verdict. This is the record.

**Rust — no usable tool, and the earlier claim is corrected.** The earlier claim
said "no healthy Rust lint reports an unnamed literal". The first half holds and
the second half does not: no CLIPPY lint reports one, and a dylint lint does.

- **clippy 0.1.97 (8bab26f4f6 2026-07-14)**, on rustc 1.97.1. `clippy-driver
  -Whelp` prints 1114 lines — every rustc lint, every clippy lint, and all nine
  groups, the opt-in `restriction` group included. Read whole, and filtered for
  `literal`, `magic`, `numeric`, `number` and `constant`: 69 lines match, and not
  one of them asks for a NAME. Each reads the literal's representation, its
  suffix, or its type — `decimal-literal-representation` (restriction) prefers
  hex, `default-numeric-fallback` (restriction) prefers a type suffix,
  `unreadable-literal` and `large-digit-groups` (pedantic) prefer underscores,
  and `inconsistent-digit-grouping`, `unusual-byte-groupings`,
  `mixed-case-hex-literals`, `zero-prefixed-literal`, `separated-literal-suffix`,
  `unseparated-literal-suffix`, `mistyped-literal-suffixes`,
  `excessive-precision`, `lossy-float-literal` and `non-ascii-literal` are the
  rest of that same family.
- **dylint (cargo-dylint 6.0.3, published 2026-08-01)** ships
  `examples/supplementary/unnamed_constant`, whose own README opens "Checks for
  unnamed constants, aka magic numbers." So the lint EXISTS, and the sentence
  that said no Rust lint reports an unnamed literal was wrong as written.

  It was installed and RUN before this verdict, in a toolchain home of its own
  so that no machine was changed. What it reads is the reason it is not taken.
  Measured over a probe crate holding one literal of each position, with the
  lint at its default `threshold` of `10`:

  | Written | Reported |
  |---|---|
  | `age > 18` | yes |
  | `part * 100` | yes |
  | `with_capacity(3600)` | yes |
  | `return 42;` | yes |
  | `n * 3600` | yes |
  | `word << 8` | no |
  | `n * 4096` | no |
  | `with_capacity(65535)` | no |
  | `42` as a tail expression | no |
  | `n * 7` | no |
  | `const NAMED_LIMIT: u64 = 4096;` | no |
  | `let timeout = 3600;` | no |

  The last two are the carve-out, and they are right. The four above them are
  the defect. `unnamed_constant` passes a value at or under the threshold, and
  it passes any value whose bits form one run — so `4096`, `65535` and every
  other power of two and all-ones mask are silent wherever they stand, and
  those are the values a name helps most. It reports `100`, which the prompt
  rule carves out for percent, and no setting restores that: `threshold` is its
  only key, and raising it to `100` would silence `status == 42` too. It reads
  a literal only where the parent node is an expression, so `return 42;`
  reports and a bare `42` tail expression does not.

  Two more properties would each be a problem on their own. The lint is
  published in no form a rule can pin: it is an example crate inside a git
  repository, built from source at first use, and it is on crates.io under no
  name. And building it needs a SECOND toolchain —
  `examples/supplementary/rust-toolchain.toml` pins
  `channel = "nightly-2026-05-28"` with
  `components = ["llvm-tools-preview", "rustc-dev"]`, because the lint links
  against `rustc_private` through `clippy_utils`. Measured: that toolchain
  takes **2.4 GB** on disk, `cargo install cargo-dylint@6.0.3
  dylint-link@6.0.3` takes 22 s, and the first `cargo dylint` run builds
  `clippy_utils` and the lint before it reads anything. Every machine that
  reviewed Rust would pay all of it, and then rebuild the crate under review
  with a custom rustc driver in a target directory of its own. Every other rule
  in this set is a released binary that runs in seconds.
- Nothing else in the space reports one either. `cargo machete`, `cargo udeps`,
  `cargo geiger`, `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` each read manifests or unsafe
  code, and `rust-code-analysis` computes metrics.

**Dart — a usable tool, and the earlier claim is reversed.** The earlier claim
said the Dart check needs a `custom_lint` package, "which is a dependency of the
project under review rather than a tool the rule can install". The first half
holds and the conclusion does not: the plugin is a dependency of the PROBE
PACKAGE the rule writes, and the project under review never sees it. The
`missing-docs-dart` rule already builds such a package, so the mechanism was in
the set before this rule used it.

- **The Dart SDK linter, 3.11.0 (Flutter 3.41.2)**: 263 rules, enumerated from
  the SDK's published rule index. None reports an unnamed literal, and the word
  "magic" appears nowhere in the index. `use_named_constants` is the nearest
  name, and it reports a literal that an EXISTING named constant already
  equals — `EdgeInsets.all(0)` for `EdgeInsets.zero` — rather than one that
  needs a name.
- **`lints` 6.1.0** (`core.yaml` 34 rules, `recommended.yaml` 55) and
  **`flutter_lints` 6.0.0** (10 rules over `recommended`): each is a selection
  from the same 263, so neither adds one.
- **`dart_code_metrics` 5.7.6**, the discontinued package the DCM verdict below
  names, carries a `no-magic-number` rule and a `metrics` executable. It cannot
  be installed on a current toolchain: its pubspec states
  `sdk: '>=2.18.0 <3.0.0'`, so `dart pub global activate` cannot resolve it
  against Dart 3.11.0. That is a firmer disqualification than "discontinued".
- **`solid_lints` 0.3.3** (a `custom_lint` plugin) carries `no_magic_number`,
  and it is what `magic-numbers-dart` runs. Measured over `dart-lang/http` at
  `a9176ac`, 324 files: 683 findings in 13 s.
- **`dart_code_linter` 4.1.9**, the maintained fork of `dart_code_metrics`, was
  measured over the same corpus: 653 findings in 5 s. It was NOT taken. It
  reports default parameter values, which the prompt rule carves out, and it
  exempts every literal inside a variable declaration's initializer, so it
  misses real findings. The rule file states the whole comparison.
- **`dcm`** is the commercial product, and the DCM verdict below still rejects
  it.

Two silent-zero traps were found and answered inside `magic-numbers-dart`, and
each one belongs to `dart run custom_lint`, the command that rule runs:
`--root-folder` does not move where `dart run custom_lint` reads its
configuration, and a failed `dart pub get` would leave a clean-looking run. Both
are recorded in the rule file.

## Function length: six tool rules, one for each language

`function-length` is the ONE size gate this set states — a function a reader
cannot hold in their head — and six tool rules supersede it, one for each
language with a linter that decides it. Each language carries exactly one such
rule.

| the rule | the tool, and the gate |
|---|---|
| `function-length-rust` | one `cargo clippy` run over `too_many_lines` at `250` |
| `function-length-typescript` | one `eslint` run over `max-lines-per-function` at `250`, with blank lines and comments skipped |
| `function-length-swift` | one `swiftlint` run over `function_body_length` and `closure_body_length`, each at `250` |
| `function-length-python` | ruff `PLR0915` at `max-statements=180` |
| `function-length-go` | `funlen` through golangci-lint at `statements: 160` |
| `function-length-dart` | `dart_code_linter` 4.2.0 at `--source-lines-of-code=250` |

Four of the six count the LINES the prompt rule counts — it says "Exclude blank
lines and comment-only lines" — so each of those carries the prompt rule's own
number, 250, with no derivation. Two count STATEMENTS instead, so each derives
its own number from a measured statements-to-lines ratio: 180 for Python and 160
for Go. Each rule file states its corpus, its commits, its file count and its
sweep.

The TypeScript rule and the Go rule each reproduce the test carve-out the prompt
rule states, and each reads it at the DEFINITION — the framework call that holds
the callback for TypeScript, and the function name `go test` requires for Go.
Python reads the name ruff anchors its diagnostic on. Rust, Swift and Dart
cannot: each rule file states what its tool offers and what the gap costs,
measured over that language's own corpus.

## Complexity is measured by nothing, and no prompt rule asks a model to

There is no `cognitive-complexity` prompt rule, there are no `complexity-<lang>`
tool rules, and the `complexity` probe is gone with them. Nothing in this set
measures cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity or nesting depth.

The reason is that no complexity gate could be made objective. A tool finding is
a requirement under this set's contract, so a gate whose findings sit mostly on
correct code makes suppressions mandatory on correct code. The Dart survey below
is the measurement that settled it, and it settled it for every language:

- At a cyclomatic gate of 15, 188 of 356 non-test findings stand at nesting
  level 2 or less — flat `??` and `&&` chains, which the cognitive metric itself
  carves out. No threshold separates them, because the flat shapes run to 149.
- At a condition-nesting gate of 4, 131 of 229 non-test findings come from
  CLOSURES rather than from conditions.

The five tool rules that shipped before this made the same trade in five
different ways, and no two of them measured the same thing: clippy counted
lexical nesting depth, swiftlint counted decision points with `switch` arms left
out, and only the eslint, gocognit and complexipy rules computed the published
Sonar score. A gate whose number depends on which language a file is written in
is not one gate.

Two tools stop being required with them: `gocognit` and `complexipy`. No
surviving rule runs either.

### The Dart survey that settled it

Dart was the last language with no gate of either kind, so the whole tool space
was read before the verdict. Every measurement was taken on Dart SDK 3.11.0 with
Flutter 3.41.2, over 3931 `.dart` files — `dart-lang/http` at `a9176ac`,
`dart-lang/shelf` at `fb3f931` and `flutter/packages` at `a3e763e` — carrying
63241 functions.

Nothing in the stock toolchain measures either concern, and no preset can add
one. **`dart analyze`** at SDK 3.11.0 has no metric layer at all; its nearest
lint, `lines_longer_than_80_chars`, reads a line's WIDTH. **`lints` 6.1.0**,
**`flutter_lints` 6.0.0**, **`very_good_analysis` 10.3.0**, **`lint` 2.8.0**,
**`altive_lints` 4.1.0** and **`pedantic_mono` 1.38.1** are each a selection
from those same SDK rules — the first four declare no dependency at all — so
none of them can carry a check the SDK does not hold.

Four tools DO compute the metrics, and one of the four is usable.

- **`dart_code_metrics` 5.7.6** (2023-07-16) is discontinued, and it pins
  `analyzer >=5.1.0 <5.14.0` against a current analyzer of 14.x.
- **`dcm`** is its commercial successor. The rejection below still holds.
- **`solid_lints` 0.3.3** carries `cyclomatic_complexity` and
  `function_lines_of_code`, and its complexity rule is BROKEN. Its `run`
  registers `addDeclaration` INSIDE the `addBlockFunctionBody` callback, so a
  body's listener is added part way through the AST walk and then fires once for
  every Declaration visited AFTER it, each time re-measuring the captured body.
  Measured over one file holding five functions of 16 `if` statements: the first
  reports 12 times, the second 10, the third 8, the fourth 6 and the fifth 4 —
  the count is the number of declarations that follow, which is a fact about
  file layout. The fatal row: a file whose ONLY declaration is one function of 20
  `if` statements reports NOTHING, and adding `int trailing(int x) => x;` after
  it makes the same function report. A dirty file reads as clean.
- **`dart_code_linter` 4.2.0** (2026-08-11, Bancolombia, MIT) is the maintained
  fork, on `analyzer >=10.0.0 <15.0.0`. It takes every threshold as a CLI flag,
  writes JSON, and reports each function once. It is what `function-length-dart`
  runs.

Nothing outside the Dart ecosystem reaches it either. **lizard** has no Dart
parser. **PMD** supports Dart for copy-paste detection alone and has no Dart
rule engine. **scc**, **tokei** and **cloc** count lines per FILE and resolve no
function boundary. **semgrep** matches patterns and aggregates no metric.
**SonarQube**'s Dart analyzer does compute cognitive complexity, and it needs a
server and `sonar-scanner`.

So one tool computes all three metrics. `source-lines-of-code` is taken, and the
other two are rejected on what they measure.

**`cyclomatic-complexity` — rejected.** A complexity gate has to carve out
configuration parsing with many options, where the score comes from a long flat
list of simple cases rather than from nesting, and Dart's dominant idioms ARE
that list: a `copyWith` of N optional parameters writes N `??` operators, an `==`
writes N `&&`, and a `lerp` writes N ternaries. Cyclomatic complexity charges one
for each. At the gate of 15 the corpus reports 356 findings outside test files,
and **188 of them stand at nesting level 2 or less** — `InputDecoration.copyWith`
scores 59 at nesting 1 and is 59 named parameters each defaulted with `??`,
`ThemeData.==` scores 85, `DatePickerThemeData.lerp` 87. The published Sonar
cognitive metric scores a sequence of `&&` once rather than once per operator, so
it rates these near zero. No threshold separates them: the flat shapes run to
149.

**`maximum-nesting-level` — rejected.** The metric reads a widget tree three
constructors deep as 1 and a collection literal four deep as 1, both correct, and
it raises the depth by one for EVERY closure body. Dart is closure-heavy. The
gate under measurement was CONDITION-nesting depth 4 or more; at that gate the corpus
reports 229 findings outside test files and only 98 of them have a condition
depth of 4 or more, so **131 of 229 come from closures rather than conditions**.
34 have condition depth 0 or 1 — `_TabScaffoldExampleState.build` reaches level 6
through nested builder callbacks with no condition at all.

Under this set's contract a tool finding is a requirement, so either gate would
make hundreds of suppressions mandatory on code a reader calls correct. That is
the trade `function-length-go` refuses for test paths, and it is the measurement
that took the complexity gate away from every language rather than from Dart
alone.

## Commented-out code: no tool rule, and the prompt rule as the whole answer

`no-commented-code` is the whole of this gate. No shipped tool rule supersedes
it, so it reads every language the set matches.

`ruff`'s `ERA001` is the one language tool measured for the question, and it is
not shipped as a rule of its own. Measured at `ruff 0.14.5` with
`--isolated --no-cache --select ERA001`: it reports each commented-out line on
its own and it states no block-length option, so it cannot express the prompt
rule's "more than 5 lines" gate — a two-line commented-out snippet reports two
findings where the prompt rule stays silent. It also answers for Python alone.

## Dead code: six tool rules, and the prompt rule as the fallback

Dead code is objective. Six tool rules supersede the `dead-code` prompt rule,
one for each language a tool covers:

| Rule | Tool | Staging marker |
|---|---|---|
| `dead-code-rust` | `cargo check` `dead_code`, plus a `grep` orphan-module scan | `#[expect(dead_code, reason = "...")]` |
| `dead-code-go` | `staticcheck -checks U1000` | `//lint:ignore U1000 <reason>` |
| `dead-code-typescript` | `ts-prune` | `// ts-prune-ignore-next` |
| `dead-code-python` | `vulture` at its default confidence | `# noqa: V103` and its sibling codes |
| `dead-code-dart` | `dart analyze`, four unused diagnostics | `// ignore: unused_element` and its siblings |
| `dead-code-swift` | `periphery scan --retain-public` | `// periphery:ignore` |

The prompt rule stays as the fallback. It reads a language no tool rule covers,
and it reads any language whose tool `sah doctor` could not find. Its file now
says so, and it carries the same standard the tools carry.

### What made the question objective

Three of the prompt rule's four carve-outs were never judgments. A compiler
exempts an exported item, a test, and an entry point on its own, because it can
see which callers exist and which cannot: rustc never reports a reachable `pub`
item, `U1000` never reports an exported Go identifier, `dart analyze`'s
`unused_element` fires only on `_`-prefixed names, and `--retain-public` is the
same exemption for Swift. Python has no compiler, so `__all__` is the marker
vulture reads.

TypeScript names its surface one level up, in the PACKAGE rather than in the
module: `package.json` `main`, `exports`, `bin` and their siblings, and the
`tsconfig.json` `paths` mapping a repository writes under its own package name.
`dead-code-typescript` reads both and hands the modules they name to ts-prune's
own `--ignore`, which is `--retain-public` for TypeScript. Measured over three
published libraries, that carve-out takes `zod` from 1946 findings to 78,
`zustand` from 9 to 1 and `redux` from 14 to 6, and it moves this workspace's 58
by zero, because both of its TypeScript projects are private applications that
publish nothing. The rule file states each measurement.

The framework-registered entry point is the one carve-out no shipped rule
reproduces for TypeScript. ts-prune has no plugin and no configuration reader,
so a `vite.config.ts` alias target, a vitest browser command and a Next.js route
module each take the marker. `knip` answers that shape natively and was measured
against this rule in full; `ts-prune` is kept on RECALL, and the superseded
verdict below records every number.

The fourth carve-out, work-in-process scaffolding, became an **annotation
contract**: staged code carries the language's own suppression marker with a
reason, or it is dead. The markers are in the table above. The
`builtin/validators/README.md` rules-for-tool-rules section states the general
form — an exemption a person would argue for in prose must become an inline
suppression the tool reads.

### Reversed and superseded decisions

- The `dead-code` **"do not supersede"** decision is reversed. It held that the
  carve-outs need a reader and that a tool replacing the prompt rule would
  report staged work as dead. The annotation contract answers the second half,
  and the compilers answer the first.
- The **`knip`** rejection is superseded by `dead-code-typescript`, and the
  question of swapping to knip was then RE-OPENED and settled on measurement.
  `ts-prune` is kept. Both reasons the original rejection stated are wrong as
  written, and both reasons the swap was proposed on are wrong as measured. The
  section below carries the whole record, and `dead-code-typescript` carries the
  tables.
- The **`periphery`** rejection is superseded by `dead-code-swift`. The earlier
  verdict was made against a directory holding a loose `.swift` file, which
  periphery refused. The fixtures now carry a `Package.swift`, which is what the
  tool asks for, and `doctor.check_command` tests for one in the project so a
  workspace without an SPM package falls back to the prompt rule.
- The **`vulture` at default confidence** rejection is superseded by
  `dead-code-python`, and `unreachable-code-python` is folded into it so that
  one finding has one owner. The high false-positive rate the earlier verdict
  named is real and is answered where it belongs — `--ignore-names` and
  `--ignore-decorators` in the run script for framework patterns, `__all__` for
  the exported surface, and `# noqa: V1xx` for one name at a time.
- The **`cargo machete`** rejection is superseded by the `manifests` set's
  `unused-dependencies-rust` rule. The rejection was right that this set cannot
  host the tool, and wrong to stop there: a set-scope gap is closed by a set.
  `manifests` matches `Cargo.toml`, so a machete finding lands on a file the
  engine keeps, and the rule runs the default mode rather than the
  `--with-metadata` mode the misreporting half of the verdict measured.

## Naming: one tool rule, and no prompt rule behind it

`stuttering-name-go` reports an exported Go type or function whose name opens
with the name of its own package, because a caller outside the package then
writes the word two times — `staged.StagedType`.

It supersedes nothing. It is one of three TOOL rules of this set to do that —
the others are `idioms-swift` and `disallowed-constructs-swift`, both below —
and one of four tree-wide, the fourth being the `manifests` set's
`unused-dependencies-rust`. Both counts are of tool rules only. The engine reads
`supersedes` on a rule that carries a `tool` block and nowhere else, so a prompt
rule declares no `supersedes` key and enters neither count.

No shipped prompt rule reads a Go NAME, and the check for that is a `match`
block rather than a reading of what each rule is about. Seven of the thirteen
shipped sets declare their own globs, and no glob among them names Go — `dart`
matches `**/*.dart`, `js-ts` matches `**/*.js`, `**/*.jsx`, `**/*.ts` and
`**/*.tsx`, `numpy` and `python` each match `**/*.py`, `rust` matches `**/*.rs`,
`swift` matches `**/*.swift`, and `manifests` matches `**/Cargo.toml`. A `.go`
file therefore reaches the other six sets alone — `code-hygiene`,
`code-security`, `completeness`, `duplication`, `reuse` and `test-integrity` —
each through the `*.go` entry of `@file_groups/source_code`, whose patterns
match at any depth. Those six sets hold 19 prompt rules between them, which is
one directory listing filtered on the `tool` frontmatter key, and
`stuttering-name-go` is the only rule of the six that reads a name at all. A
reader checks that with a command rather than by deciding what a rule is about.
A machine without `revive` therefore gets no answer to this question rather than
a worse one.

| Rule | Tool | Inline suppression |
|---|---|---|
| `stuttering-name-go` | `revive` `exported`, the `naming` category | `//revive:disable-next-line:exported` |

`missing-docs-go` runs the SAME revive rule and owns the other half of it. The
`exported` rule answers two kinds of finding under one rule name and tells them
apart by CATEGORY: a documentation finding carries `comments` and a repetitive
name carries `naming`. `missing-docs-go` states `disableStutteringCheck` and
owns the `comments` half; `stuttering-name-go` states no argument and selects
the `naming` half. The two together are revive's whole `exported` output with no
finding owned two times and none dropped, and the acceptance test
`the_shipped_go_rules_that_run_revives_exported_rule_split_its_findings` drives
both shipped scripts over one file and holds that split.

### The naming survey

The whole Go lint space was read before the rule was written, and each candidate
was RUN over one probe file. `revive`'s `exported` rule holds the check alone.

- **revive 1.15.0**: 12 rules write the `naming` category — `confusing-naming`,
  `confusing-results`, `epoch-naming`, `error-naming`, `exported`,
  `import-shadowing`, `package-directory-mismatch`, `package-naming`,
  `receiver-naming`, `unexported-naming`, `use-any` and `var-naming`. Over a
  probe holding a documented repetitive type, an undocumented repetitive type,
  an underscore name, a name equal to the package name, a name whose next rune
  is lower case, a repetitive constant, variable, function and method, and one
  unexported type: `exported` reports the four repetitive names, `var-naming`
  reports the UNDERSCORE alone, and the other ten are silent.
- **staticcheck 2025.1.1**, `-checks all` over the same probe: `ST1000`,
  `ST1003` on the same underscore, and `U1000` on the unexported type.
  staticcheck names more than `exported` does — `ST1003` reads an underscore and
  an initialism, and `ST1006`, `ST1011`, `ST1012` and `ST1016` each read a name
  of their own — and none of them reads a name against its package.
- **golangci-lint 2.12.2** with `default: all`, which is 115 linters: only
  `revive` reports the repetition, and `unused` reports the dead type.

`stuttering-name-go` drives revive DIRECTLY rather than through golangci-lint,
so it needs neither the `GOLANGCI_LINT_CACHE` directory nor the
`allow-serial-runners` key that `magic-numbers-go` and `function-length-go`
carry. Both halves are measured in the rule file: eight runs started together in
one workspace each reported every finding, and a module of 400 packages took the
same time cold and warm at two different paths.

## Swift idioms: one tool rule, and the prompt bullets it stands beside

`idioms-swift` runs `swiftformat --lint` over a roster of 28 rules, each of
which rewrites one Swift shape into an equivalent shape. The two forms compile
to the same program, so the tool's answer is a fact about the source rather
than a preference. The roster is Airbnb's, taken from
`Sources/AirbnbSwiftFormatTool/airbnb.swiftformat` and narrowed to the rules
that decide an IDIOM: the formatting rules — `indent`, every `wrap*`,
`sortImports`, `blankLines*`, `spaceAround*`, `trailingSpace`, `braces`,
`semicolons` — are deliberately left out, because a whitespace finding in a
diff review is noise and the format step already owns it.

| Rule | Tool | Inline suppression |
|---|---|---|
| `idioms-swift` | `swiftformat --lint`, 28 named rules | `// swiftformat:disable:next <rule>` |

It supersedes nothing, and that is a fact of the `supersedes` key rather than a
reading of what the rule is about. The key names a WHOLE prompt rule and the
engine skips that rule whole. This gate decides SIX bullets spread across two
prompt rules of the `swift` set — five of `idioms.md` and one of
`value-semantics.md` — and neither rule is only those bullets, so naming either
one would take its other bullets out of every review the moment swiftformat is
installed. Taking those six bullets out of the prompt text is a change of its
own; until it lands, both halves state the same requirement and they agree.

Two properties of swiftformat shape the run, and the rule file measures each.
A rule name SwiftFormat does not know breaks the WHOLE run at status 70, and
`--unknown-rules ignore` moves nothing on the command line, so the script
intersects its roster with `swiftformat --rules` before it lints — two of
Airbnb's 28 stand in no released SwiftFormat. And one refusing path costs a
single swiftformat run every finding it made, which is the answer
`builtin/validators/README.md` refuses, so the script hands swiftformat one
path for each run and states each path it declined on the marked stderr
channel.

The version floor is SwiftFormat **0.62.1**, the version every rule of the
roster was measured present in. `doctor.check_command` carries it through
`--min-version`, so a machine whose swiftformat is too old reports as a missing
tool rather than silently dropping the rules an older release lacks.

## Swift disallowed constructs: one tool rule, and the annotation as the exemption

`disallowed-constructs-swift` runs `swiftlint` over TWELVE rules, and every
construct they name has a replacement the language already holds: a force
unwrap has `??`, a `try!` has `try?`, an `as!` has `as?`, a `CGPointMake` has
`CGPoint(x:y:)`, a `print` has a logger. So the tool's answer is a fact about
the source rather than a preference.

Nine are swiftlint's own — `implicitly_unwrapped_optional`, `force_unwrapping`,
`force_try`, `force_cast`, `unused_optional_binding`, `unowned_variable_capture`,
`legacy_constructor`, `legacy_nsgeometry_functions` and
`legacy_cggeometry_functions`. Three are custom regex rules copied from Airbnb's
`Sources/AirbnbSwiftFormatTool/swiftlint.yml`: `no_direct_standard_out_logs`,
`no_file_literal` and `no_unchecked_sendable`.

| Rule | Tool | Inline suppression |
|---|---|---|
| `disallowed-constructs-swift` | `swiftlint`, 9 stock rules and 3 custom regex rules | `// swiftlint:disable:next <rule>` |

It supersedes nothing, for the same reason `idioms-swift` does. This gate
decides FIVE bullets spread across three prompt rules of the `swift` set — two
of `optionals.md`, two of `error-handling.md` and one of `concurrency.md` — and
none of the three is only those bullets.

**The three custom rules are the reason to copy Airbnb's file rather than write
one.** Each turns an LLM judgment into a regex plus an escape hatch, and
`no_unchecked_sendable` is the shape that matters. `concurrency.md` states its
requirement as pure judgment — "`@unchecked Sendable` requires a documented
synchronization invariant. The smell is the *absence* of a lock/isolation
mechanism and a comment." No tool can answer "is there a documented invariant".
A tool CAN require an explicit annotation, and the TEXT of that annotation is
the invariant. Airbnb's message says so in as many words, and this rule keeps
that message: write `// swiftlint:disable:next no_unchecked_sendable` above the
declaration with the reason after it. The exemption became an annotation, which
is the standing answer this whole set gives to a judgment.

`match_kinds` is what makes a regex rule safe here. Measured over one probe
holding a `print(` call, the same word inside a string literal, inside a `//`
comment and inside a `///` doc comment: the shipped `match_kinds: [identifier]`
reports the call alone, and the same regex without the key reports all four.

**The three force rules stay off inside a test target**, because
`optionals.md` and `error-handling.md` each say "in non-test code" and mean it.
Airbnb reaches the same split from the other side, with the swiftformat rules
`noForceUnwrapInTests` and `noForceTryInTests` that `idioms-swift` enables. The
split cannot live in the configuration: measured on swiftlint 0.65.0, an
`excluded:` key under `force_unwrapping:` is answered with
`warning: Configuration for 'force_unwrapping' rule contains the invalid key(s)
'excluded'.` and both files still report. So the SCRIPT partitions its own
paths, from the `Tests/` convention and from the test targets
`swift package describe` names, and the rule file states every measurement.

## Tools measured and rejected

Five candidates were rejected. Four were installed and run before the verdict;
the fifth cannot be installed on the terms this set needs.

Three of the five verdicts no longer hold. `cargo machete`, `knip` and
`periphery` are marked superseded below, and the dead-code section above records
what replaced each one. A superseded verdict is kept rather than deleted, so a
reader can see what was measured, and when it stopped being the answer.

### `clippy::cognitive_complexity` — rejected

Clippy's own branch count, and the obvious candidate for a Rust complexity gate.
Rejected because it walks the macro-expanded AST.

This workspace builds `tracing` with the `log` feature. The log bridge expands
each call site into many branches, and clippy attributes those branches to the
caller. Measured on two probe crates with a byte-identical `src/lib.rs`, one
building `tracing` with `default-features = false` and one with the `log`
feature on: a flat, zero-branch function holding six `tracing` calls scores 7
without the feature and 43 with it.

The noise grows with how often a function logs, so no threshold separates it
from real branching, and the pipe cannot filter it — the finding carries a
function and a number, nothing more. At the gate of 15 it reports 460 findings
across this workspace, the mass of them sitting just over the gate.

Nothing replaces it. The section "Complexity is measured by nothing" above
states why no complexity gate ships for any language.

### `cargo machete` — rejected, and the rejection is superseded by the `manifests` set

Unused Rust dependencies. Rejected for two independent reasons.

It cannot report. Every machete finding names a `Cargo.toml`, and this set
matches `@file_groups/source_code`, which declares no manifest pattern. A rule's
`match` narrows its set's and never widens it, and a `workspace`-scope run keeps
only the findings whose path is a matched changed file. A `Cargo.toml` finding
is therefore dropped on every path through the engine.

It also misreports. In `--with-metadata`, its accurate mode, it reports
`tauri-build` unused for `kanban-app` and for `mirdan-app`. Both build scripts
call `tauri_build::build()`. Its default mode misses that dependency kind by
scanning source text for the crate name, which cannot see a renamed or
feature-gated use either.

Unused dependencies are a manifest question, not a source-code one. A validator
set that matches manifests could host this tool; this set cannot.

That last sentence is what happened. The `manifests` set matches `Cargo.toml`,
and its `unused-dependencies-rust` rule hosts the tool. The misreporting half of
the verdict was answered rather than argued away: it is a property of
`--with-metadata`, and the rule runs the default mode, where neither `kanban-app`
nor `mirdan-app` appears among the 141 findings on this workspace. The default
mode's own blind spot — a dependency named by no source because a feature turns
it on — is real, and it is what
`[package.metadata.cargo-machete] ignored` is for. The rule's own file records
both measurements.

### `knip` — rejected, and the rejection is superseded by `dead-code-typescript`

Unused JavaScript and TypeScript files and exports. Run zero-config against
`apps/kanban-app/ui` with a full dependency tree installed.

It reports findings that are not defects. It calls
`src/test/stubs/tauri-plugin-dialog.ts` an unused file, but `vite.config.ts`
names that exact path as a `resolve.alias` target. It calls `info`, `debug`, and
`trace` unused exports of `src/lib/log.ts`, which is a one-line re-export
facade. Most of its 61 unused-export findings are the exported surface the
`dead-code` rule carves out, and knip has no way to tell that surface from a
leftover.

It also cannot meet the fixture contract. Knip reads a project — `package.json`,
`tsconfig.json`, and an installed `node_modules` — never a loose file, and
"unused" is a whole-project question, so a fail fixture and a pass fixture in
one directory cannot be judged apart.

**Both halves of that verdict were re-measured on 2026-08-14, and both are
wrong as written.** The second half is refuted by the shipped rule itself:
ts-prune also reads a project and never a loose file, and the fixture directory
now carries a `tsconfig.json.tmpl` that names the two TypeScript dead-code
fixtures, so the pair is judged the same way the Swift pair is. The first half
was measured against one private APPLICATION, which is the workspace where a
package declares no surface at all. Measured against three published libraries —
`zod` at `4e1720c`, `zustand` at `2115efb` and `redux` at `3084fc3` — knip's
entry-point resolution is the thing this set wants, and its plugins answer the
framework-registered entry point that `dead-code-typescript` still leaves to a
marker.

**The swap was then measured in full, and `ts-prune` is KEPT.** The comparison
that motivated it — zod 78 against 13, zustand 1 against 0, redux 6 against 2 —
was itself taken with NO `node_modules`, where knip fails to load a project's
vitest configuration and still exits 1. zustand's 0 was a broken run. The
command also named `nsExports` and `nsTypes`, two spellings that select nothing
in 6.32.2.

Re-measured with dependencies installed and knip tuned — given the entry list
`dead-code-typescript` already computes, an `ignore` from each tsconfig's
`exclude`, and `ignoreExportsUsedInFile` — both of knip's losses go away, so it
was not rejected a second time on a configuration nobody tried:

| workspace | `dead-code-typescript` | knip tuned | genuinely dead, this rule | genuinely dead, knip | both name | union |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| zod | 76 | 7 | 28 | 4 | 0 | 32 |
| zustand | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| redux | 6 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| all three | 83 | 8 | 29 | 5 | 1 | 33 |

knip wins precision — 5 of its 8 findings are genuinely dead, 63 %, against 29
of this rule's 83, 35 % — and it is faster on every workspace, 0.4 s against
10.8 s on zod. RECALL decided it: of the 33 genuinely dead symbols the two tools
jointly name, this rule names 29 and tuned knip names 5, and the two agree on
ONE symbol, `redux` `scripts/mangleErrors.mts:187` `default`. So the swap gives
up 28 symbols and gains 4. knip resolves reachability FIRST, so a module no
entry reaches becomes ONE positionless `files` entry whose exports are never
enumerated, and over zod that swallows 27 of the 28 into six lines with no
names. No configuration changes it. `dead-code-typescript` reports `path:line`
on changed files, and an author adding a module nothing imports yet is exactly
the shape knip cannot report by symbol.

Two facts recorded against a future re-opening. knip's staging marker EXPIRES,
which `// ts-prune-ignore-next` never does: a custom JSDoc tag under
`--tags=-<name>` raises `Unused tag ...` the moment the consumer lands. And a
`tsconfig.json` that is not JSON is silent under BOTH tools, so the swap would
not have answered the open card about a broken tool reading as a clean tree.
`dead-code-typescript` carries every measurement.

### `periphery` — rejected, and the rejection is superseded by `dead-code-swift`

Unused Swift declarations. Installed at 3.8.0 and run against a directory
holding a loose `.swift` file. It refused: "Failed to identify project in the
current directory. For Xcode projects use the '--project' option, and for SPM
projects change to the directory containing the Package.swift."

Periphery needs an Xcode project or an SPM package, and it builds that project
to index it. A review pass cannot pay a full build, and the fixture contract
gives a tool one loose file.

Both halves of that verdict were answered rather than argued away. The fixture
directory now carries a `Package.swift.tmpl` whose one target names `path: "."`
and lists the two Swift dead-code fixtures, so the tool gets the package it
asks for. And the build is not a full one: measured on `Alamofire` at HEAD,
`swift build --build-tests` takes 5 s warm and the scan itself 1 s, and the
build is the project's own incremental cargo-equivalent, not a clean rebuild.

### DCM — rejected, and this is why Dart runs a fork rather than the product

Dart's complexity and length metrics. It is not a tool this set can ship.

The claim this section used to open with — that DCM is the ONLY Dart tool that
computes those metrics — is wrong as written. `dart_code_linter` 4.2.0 is a
maintained MIT fork of the same code base, it is free, it needs no key, and
`function-length-dart` runs it. The complexity survey above records that
measurement, and it records why the two metrics beside `source-lines-of-code`
are still rejected — on what they MEASURE, rather than on how they install.

`dart_code_metrics` on pub.dev is discontinued at 5.7.6 and declares no
replacement package; its homepage now points at `dcm.dev`, which is a commercial
product. The Free tier is one seat and stops at 50k analyzed lines of code, and
a CI/CD license key — what an unattended review run needs — starts at the Teams
plan.

Both halves of the tool-rule contract fail on that. `install.commands` must pin
a version, and there is no free pinnable package left to pin: the pub package is
discontinued and the live product installs against a license. And a rule whose
tool needs a purchased key cannot degrade to its prompt rule cleanly for the
projects that do not hold one — it would be missing on every machine but the
buyer's.
