//! Acceptance tests for the shipped `disallowed-constructs-swift` tool rule.
//!
//! Each test drives the SHIPPED script over a probe repository and reads what
//! the real swiftlint reported.
//!
//! Four answers stand apart from every other Swift rule of this set, and one
//! test holds each. The gate names TWELVE rules, and swiftlint answers a name
//! it does not know with a warning and a healthy exit, so a misspelling would
//! cost one rule and read as a clean run. Three of the twelve stay off inside a
//! test target, and swiftlint carries no per-rule path filter for a stock rule,
//! so the SCRIPT partitions its own paths — from the `Tests/` convention and
//! from the test targets the package manifest names. And each of the three
//! custom regex rules matches a token of the KIND its `match_kinds` names, so a
//! comment and a string literal holding the same words stay silent.
//!
//! Each of those two sets of three is read off the shipped script rather than
//! written here as a list, and every name it holds carries a probe. So a rule
//! added to either set fails these tests until it carries a probe of its own.
//!
//! One more test stands apart because of what it protects rather than what it
//! measures. This gate took five bullets out of the Swift prompt rules, and a
//! bullet deleted without a tool that reads it is a requirement the set states
//! nowhere. The last test in this file holds each of those five to being
//! reported by its rule AND stated by no prompt rule.
