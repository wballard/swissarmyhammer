//! Engine stage 4 — synthesize: dedup, order, render the dated checklist.
//!
//! This is the final, deterministic, LLM-free stage and the pipeline's single
//! barrier. [`run_review`] drives stages 1–3 to completion — fan-out and verify
//! both drain the shared [`AgentPool`](crate::validators::AgentPool) by awaiting
//! every task they submit — then hands the resulting `Vec<`[`VerifiedFinding`]`>`
//! to [`synthesize`], which turns it into the deduped, ordered [`ReviewReport`].
//!
//! # What synthesis does
//!
//! Review is a **binary pass/fail** model: a confirmed finding is a failure,
//! full stop — there is no graded severity. [`synthesize`] is pure and
//! clock-free: the timestamp is an **input**, never read inside the engine, so
//! the same findings always render the same report. It:
//!
//! 1. **Counts** confirmed vs refuted across every input finding.
//! 2. **Drops refuted** findings ([`VerifiedFinding::confirmed`] is `false`).
//! 3. **Dedups conservatively** — it collapses only *exact repeats*
//!    (same `file`, `line`, `validator`, `rule`, and byte-identical `claim`).
//!    There is no fuzzy/similarity matching, and findings from *different*
//!    validators on the same `file:line` are distinct lenses, never merged.
//! 4. **Orders** the surviving findings by `file:line` into ONE flat checklist
//!    so co-located concerns render together (ordering is not merging — every
//!    surviving concern is its own checklist item).
//! 5. **Renders** the dated GFM section in the exact shape the review skill
//!    already writes onto kanban tasks (`builtin/skills/review/SKILL.md` step 8),
//!    so the existing task-history parsing keeps working. Every item names its
//!    validator set and rule beside the `file:line`, so the reader of a card can
//!    open the rule that produced a finding without searching for it.

/// 2. [`plan_tool_rules`] + [`start_tool_runs`] — plan every matched tool
///    rule ONCE for the whole run, before any batching, and start the healthy
///    ones at the workspace root. The plan's suppression map rides into every
///    batch's fan-out so a superseded prompt rule is skipped per file; an
///    unhealthy tool suppresses nothing and is reported as a prompt fallback.
///    The scripts then run WHILE stage 4 works, because the fan-out needs only
///    that map and the tool findings are read at synthesis. Those findings
///    join the verified stream as CONFIRMED (deterministic tool output skips
///    the adversarial verify pass).
/// 3. [`batch_work_list`] — split the work-list into budgeted batches at
///    whole-file granularity so no single prompt overflows the agent's prompt
///    cap. [`FleetConfig::batch_budget`] supplies both numbers, spent in
///    RENDERED bytes: [`FleetConfig::file_payload_budget`] (the cap less the
///    run's measured framing) sets the batch boundaries, so a small diff is one
///    batch and a large one is several; the constant
///    [`FleetConfig::file_block_cap`] decides the over-cap verdict, so a
///    (validator, file) pair over it is excluded and reported as a named gap
///    (see [`SkippedFile`]), never a hard error.
/// 4. For **each batch**, independently: [`run_fleet`] fans every validator out
///    across the shared `pool` over that batch's files (its own shared prime,
///    forked per validator), then [`verify_findings`] pairs each candidate back
///    with its file's ground-truth context ([`build_candidates`]) and runs the
///    adversarial refute pass on the **same** `pool` — forking that batch's prime
///    while it stays pinned, then releasing the pin once the batch has drained.
/// 5. [`synthesize`] — merge every batch's confirmed [`VerifiedFinding`]s and
///    turn them into the dated, deduped, ordered [`ReviewReport`] (synthesis dedups
///    by `file:line`, so cross-batch findings collapse the same as within a batch).
///
/// Because each batch awaits all the tasks it submits before the next begins, the
/// shared pool fully drains between batches and the prime pin never outlives its
/// batch. A one-batch run (the common small diff) is byte-for-byte the old single
/// fan-out → verify path. The engine never reads the clock: `now` is the
/// caller-supplied, already-formatted local timestamp (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`)
/// rendered verbatim into the report header.
///
/// `progress` is the optional [`ReviewProgressSender`] handed through to
/// [`run_fleet`] so each batch emits its `Planned`/`PairStarted`/`PairDone`
/// events; `None` emits nothing.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns the [`AvpError`] from [`scope_review`] on git or index failure, or when
/// a matched validator declares an unknown probe. [`batch_work_list`] never
/// errors: a file whose rendered block is over the per-file cap is
/// excluded and reported as a named
/// gap instead. Fan-out and verify failures never error either: a failed task
/// degrades to zero findings (fan-out) or a refute-by-default verdict (verify),
/// so the report is always produced.
