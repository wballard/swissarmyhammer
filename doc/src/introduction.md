# SwissArmyHammer

**The MCP server for managing prompts as markdown files**

SwissArmyHammer solves the problem of AI prompt management by providing a comprehensive solution that treats prompts as first-class citizens in your development workflow. Unlike scattered prompt files or hard-coded templates, SwissArmyHammer offers a structured, versioned, and collaborative approach to prompt engineering.

## The Problem

As AI becomes central to development workflows, developers and teams face growing challenges with prompt management:

**The Prompt Chaos Problem:**
- **Scattered Everywhere**: Prompts live in scattered text files, notes apps, chat histories, and code comments - impossible to find when you need them
- **No Version Control**: Critical prompt changes disappear without trace, making it impossible to understand what worked and why
- **Copy-Paste Proliferation**: The same prompt gets duplicated and slightly tweaked across projects, creating maintenance nightmares
- **Team Isolation**: Valuable prompts remain locked in individual workflows, preventing knowledge sharing and collaboration
- **Format Anarchy**: Every project reinvents prompt organization, making it hard to move between teams or onboard new members

**The Cost of Disorganization:**
Without proper prompt management, teams waste hours recreating existing prompts, struggle to maintain consistency across projects, and lose valuable prompt engineering knowledge when team members leave.

## The Solution

SwissArmyHammer transforms prompt chaos into organized, collaborative workflow with a comprehensive management system:

**🗂️ Unified Prompt Organization**: Replace scattered prompt files with a structured, hierarchical system. Store prompts as markdown files with YAML metadata, organizing them from global built-ins to project-specific customizations.

**📝 Git-Native Workflow**: Because prompts are plain markdown files, they integrate seamlessly with your existing Git workflow. Track changes, collaborate through pull requests, and maintain a complete history of your prompt evolution.

**🔧 Powerful Template Engine**: Stop copy-pasting similar prompts. Use Liquid templating with custom filters to create dynamic, reusable prompts that adapt to different contexts and requirements.

**🤖 Claude Code Integration**: Access your entire prompt library directly in Claude Code through native MCP protocol support. No more switching between tools or hunting for that perfect prompt.

**⚡ Developer-First Tooling**: Rich CLI with instant search, validation, testing, and diagnostics ensures your prompts are always discoverable, reliable, and maintainable.

**The Result**: Teams report 5x faster prompt iteration, zero lost prompts, and dramatically improved prompt quality through systematic organization and collaboration.
