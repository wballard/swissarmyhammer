//! Tests for [tool-rule planning and execution](super).
//!
//! The tests are split by subject, one module for each. The review engine
//! renders a whole file into one agent prompt, and a file over the per-file
//! prompt cap is not reviewed at all, so a test tree this size has to be
//! several files rather than one.
//!
//! - [`plan`] — planning over built specs: what a healthy rule suppresses,
//!   what a missing tool falls back to, and which files a rule matches.
//! - [`execute`] — running the planned scripts, and the report types the run
//!   fills.
//! - [`preconditions`] — how a shipped-rule test states the tool it needs, and
//!   what it prints when the machine lacks it.
//! - [`shipped`] — each shipped tool rule driven end to end against its own
//!   language.
//!
//! This module carries what those four share: the imports, the shipped
//! tool-rule rosters, and the helpers that build a work-list and hold a run to
//! its finding.

/// The name of one shipped missing-docs tool rule, as a literal.
///
/// The name stands in a macro beside the constant that holds it because
/// `concat!` takes literals, and a test builds several `&'static str`
/// constants that spell a rule's name inside a longer string: the name of its
/// fail fixture, and the line its script writes for a file it cannot read. A
/// constant cannot feed `concat!`, so those would each restate the name.
///
/// The macro stands above the `mod` declarations because `macro_rules!` is
/// scoped by position, and a module declared above a macro cannot see it.
