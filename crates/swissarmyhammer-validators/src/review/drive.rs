//! Engine driver — wire a live ACP agent into the review pipeline.
//!
//! [`run_review`](crate::review::run_review) is the pure pipeline barrier: it
//! takes an already-built [`AgentPool`](crate::validators::AgentPool) plus the
//! resolved scope, loader, index connection and embedder. This module owns the
//! one piece of choreography the pure barrier deliberately leaves out — standing
//! the [`AgentPool`] up over a live ACP agent — so the MCP tool stays a thin
//! dispatch shim that supplies the agent and the scope and gets a
//! [`ReviewReport`] back.
//!
//! [`run_review_over_agent`] takes the two halves of an ACP agent handle (the
//! [`DynConnectTo<Client>`] component and a `broadcast::Receiver` of the agent's
//! streamed `session/update` notifications), builds the
//! `Client.builder().connect_with(...)` connection that yields a typed
//! [`ConnectionTo<Agent>`], constructs the shared [`AgentPool`] over it (sized by
//! the caller's [`PoolConfig`]), and runs [`run_review`](crate::review::run_review)
//! inside the connection. The pool — and therefore every agent task — lives only
//! for the duration of the pipeline; the connection tears down when the report is
//! ready.
//!
//! # Single notification path
//!
//! The pool's per-prompt collectors are fed from exactly ONE source: the agent's
//! own `notification_rx` broadcast, drained by [`forward_notifications`] into the
//! pool's [`NotificationSender`](claude_agent::NotificationSender). That is the
//! authoritative stream a real handle exposes — for a
//! `swissarmyhammer_agent::AcpAgentHandle`, `notification_rx` is a `resubscribe()`
//! of the backend's broadcast channel, the same channel
//! `wrap_claude_into_handle` bridges onto the connection via
//! `forward_session_notifications`. Because that bridge re-emits the very same
//! notifications onto the connection, the driver must NOT also forward what the
//! connection re-emits — doing so delivers every streamed chunk twice and
//! [`collect_response_content`](claude_agent::collect_response_content) would
//! concatenate the agent's reply twice, corrupting the JSON the fleet/verify
//! parser reads. Forwarding solely from `notification_rx` keeps delivery
//! single-path for both the real handle and a scripted agent.
