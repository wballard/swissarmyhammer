//! Engine stage 1 — resolve a review scope into a per-validator work-list.
//!
//! This is the first, deterministic, LLM-free stage of the review pipeline. Given
//! a [`Scope`] (exactly one of `working` / `sha` / `file` / `glob`) it produces a
//! [`WorkList`]: the review-level [change purpose](WorkList::change_purpose()) plus,
//! per matched validator, the files to review. The **validator is the shard; the
//! file is the grain** — each [`FileWork`] carries that file's structured semantic
//! diff, the changed symbols, a *bounded* [`source_slice`](FileWork::source_slice())
//! (header + changed entities + hunk windows, never the whole file), and the
//! engine-run probe evidence for the validator's declared probes.
//!
//! # Reuse, never reimplement
//!
//! The stage composes existing pieces and adds no git/glob/probe logic of its own:
//!
//! - **Diff scopes** reuse the same library primitives the `git` tool is built on:
//!   [`swissarmyhammer_git::GitOperations`] for the changed-file set (working tree,
//!   range/sha) and [`compute_semantic_diff`] for the entity-level diff. The `git`
//!   MCP tool itself lives in the `swissarmyhammer-tools` crate and is *not*
//!   library-callable from the engine (depending on it would invert the dependency
//!   direction), so — as the task authorizes — this is the factored shared git-ops
//!   call site: it calls the underlying `swissarmyhammer-git` + `swissarmyhammer-sem`
//!   crates directly, exactly as the tool does, never shelling out, never
//!   reimplementing diffing.
//! - **Validator matching** reuses [`crate::match_rules`]' matching code path via a
//!   caller-supplied [`ValidatorLoader`] (`matching_rulesets`), so the loader is
//!   built once rather than reloaded per file.
//! - **Probes** reuse [`crate::review::run_probes`]; each distinct `(file, probe)`
//!   runs exactly once and the shared result is handed to every validator that
//!   declared it — N+M probe calls for a large diff, never N×M.
