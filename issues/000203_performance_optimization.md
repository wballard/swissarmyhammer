# Performance Optimization and Overhead Minimization

## Summary

Optimize the cost tracking system to meet the performance requirements specified in the PRD: less than 50ms overhead per API call, minimal memory usage, and efficient resource management throughout the system.

## Context

Cost tracking must not impact the core functionality of SwissArmyHammer. The specification requires less than 50ms overhead per API call and minimal system resource usage. This step optimizes all cost tracking components for performance.

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
- Create: `swissarmyhammer/src/cost/performance/`
- Add: `mod.rs`, `benchmarks.rs`, `profiling.rs`, `optimization.rs`

### Optimization Components

```rust
pub struct PerformanceOptimizer {
    benchmarks: BenchmarkSuite,
    profiler: CostTrackingProfiler,
    resource_manager: ResourceManager,
}

   // Minimize data copying
   ```

3. **Storage Optimization**
   ```rust
   // Batch write operations
   // Use efficient serialization (bincode vs JSON)
   // Async storage with queues
   // Database connection pooling
   ```

4. **Aggregation Optimization**
   ```rust
   // Incremental statistics calculation

   ```

### Benchmarking Framework

Create comprehensive benchmarks:

    // Measure token counting performance
}

#[bench]
fn bench_cost_calculation(b: &mut Bencher) {
    // Measure cost calculation speed
}

#[bench]
fn bench_storage_operations(b: &mut Bencher) {
    // Measure storage performance
}
```

### Memory Tests
- Memory leak detection
- Peak memory usage validation
- Memory pool efficiency testing
- Garbage collection impact

### Regression Tests
- Performance regression detection
- Baseline performance validation
- Resource usage monitoring
- Long-running performance tests

## Configuration

Add performance tuning options:
```yaml

    flush_interval_ms: 1000
    memory_pool_size: 10000
    connection_pool_size: 10
    enable_profiling: false  # For development only
```
