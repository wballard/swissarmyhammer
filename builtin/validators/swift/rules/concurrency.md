# Swift Concurrency

- **Prefer `async`/`await` over completion-handler callbacks in new code.** Flag a newly added `@escaping (Result<…>) -> Void` / `completion:` for inherently async work at a public boundary. DO: `func loadUser(id: User.ID) async throws -> User`.
- **Types that cross actor/task boundaries must be `Sendable`.** Don't pass a mutable non-`Sendable` class across an `await` or task boundary.
- **Model new shared mutable state as an `actor`, not a hand-rolled `DispatchQueue`/`NSLock`.**
- **Don't leak unstructured `Task { }`; prefer structured concurrency.** DO: `async let a = fetchA(); async let b = fetchB()`, or `withTaskGroup` for a dynamic set. Store long-lived `Task` handles, cancel them in teardown, and check `Task.isCancelled`/`Task.checkCancellation()` in loops — `cancel()` is a no-op if nothing checks. DON'T: `Task { while true { await tick() } }`.
- **Annotate UI-facing state and types with `@MainActor`** instead of manual `DispatchQueue.main.async` hops.
- **Don't capture non-`Sendable` state in a `@Sendable` closure** (those passed to `Task`, `Task.detached`, `addTask`) — capture a `Sendable` copy instead.
