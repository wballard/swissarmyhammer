# `.validators/`

The **validator store** for SwissArmyHammer (`sah`). This directory is created
and maintained by `sah init`.

## What's here

Each subdirectory is one **validator set** — a named bundle of code-review rules
(for example `rust/`, `code-hygiene/`, `code-security/`). A set is a folder
with a `VALIDATOR.md` (the set manifest) plus a `rules/` directory of rule
files. The review engine reads this directory directly — validators are
**not** symlinked into agent directories.

The set manifest carries the shared metadata, including the `match` block:

    ---
    name: code-hygiene
    description: >-
      Flag hygiene defects in changed source code.
    match:
      files:
        - "@file_groups/source_code"
    probes:
      - callers
    ---

Every rule in the set inherits the set's `match`. A rule file carries `name`
and `description`, then its body.

## Rule kinds

There are two kinds of rule. Both kinds share the same metadata and the same
`match` mechanics. Only execution differs.

- **Prompt rule** — the rule body is a prompt. An LLM reads the body and the
  changed code, and reports the findings. This is the default kind.
- **Tool rule** — the rule frontmatter has a `tool` block. A language tool
  examines the code and reports the findings. No LLM reads the code. The
  result is the same on every run.

A rule with a `tool` block is a tool rule. A rule without one is a prompt
rule. There is no separate directory, no separate schema, and no separate
matcher — a tool rule is a rule with more keys.

## What a rule may report on

The engine, not the rule, decides which lines a finding may land on. The op the
caller ran decides it, and the prompt states it in the same two words every
time:

- **REVIEW** — the subject. Under `review working` and `review sha`, only the
  lines the change added or modified — the prompt marks each one `+`. Under
  `review file`, every line of each named file.
- **CONSIDER** — context. Surrounding pre-existing code, read to judge the
  subject correctly, never itself the subject of a finding.

So a rule body says WHAT is a defect, never WHERE to look for one. Do not write
"check the whole file", "report pre-existing instances too", or "not just the
diff" into a rule: under a diff op those instructions are wrong, and the verify
guard refutes such a finding before it reaches the report. Write "report every
instance in scope" instead, and let the prompt say what scope is.

A rule may still narrow further, and several do — `case-sensitivity-coverage`
fires only on a comparison the diff itself added. Narrowing is a rule's
business; widening past the op's subject is not.

## Tool rules

A tool rule binds one tool to one language. Example:

    # rules/magic-numbers-python.md — the keys, with the `run` script left out
    ---
    name: magic-numbers-python
    description: Unnamed Python literals need constants — checked by ruff, not by prompt.
    match:
      files:
        - "**/*.py"
      project_types:
        - python
    supersedes: magic-numbers
    tool:
      scope: files
      run: |
        ...
      doctor:
        check_command: "which ruff jq mktemp"
        check_version_command: "ruff --version"
      install:
        commands:
          - "uv tool install ruff==0.14.5"
          - "pipx install ruff==0.14.5"
    ---

Those are the keys of `rules/magic-numbers-python.md`. Its own frontmatter is
50 lines, because the `run` this example leaves out is a script of 30: the
zero-argument guard this contract states, ruff run into a file of its own, the
status gate, the filter that selects the findings, and the channel that states
each item ruff declined. `rules/missing-docs-python.md` holds the same shape
for the same tool, and its script is 52 lines.

The `match` block is the same block the set manifest uses — the same struct,
the same file patterns, the same `@file_groups` references. Two additions:

- A tool rule may carry its own `match`. It narrows the set's match — the rule
  applies to the intersection. A rule never matches a file its set does not
  match.
- `project_types` is a new key in the same `match` block. It names the
  detected project types the rule serves. Install and configuration also key
  on it.

The keys under `match` combine with an implicit AND. Every key that is present
must match. A key that is absent matches everything. The values inside one key
combine with OR. So `files: ["**/*.py"]` plus `project_types: [python]` means:
the file matches the pattern AND the workspace is a python project.

`supersedes` names the prompt rules this tool rule replaces. When the tool is
healthy, each named prompt rule is skipped for the files this rule matches.
When the tool is missing, each named prompt rule runs as before. This is the
fallback mechanism.

Write one name, or a list of names:

    supersedes: missing-docs

    supersedes:
      - function-length
      - missing-docs

One tool run can replace more than one prompt rule, and the list is how a rule
says so. No shipped rule names two today. A shipped tool rule replaces one
prompt rule or none: every shipped tool rule but `stuttering-name-go`,
`unused-dependencies-rust`, `idioms-swift` and `disallowed-constructs-swift`
names exactly one, and those four declare no `supersedes` key at all.

The first two have no prompt rule to name, and both times that follows from a
`match` block rather than from a survey of what each rule is
about: a `Cargo.toml` reaches the `manifests` set alone, whose `rules/`
directory holds `unused-dependencies-rust` and nothing else, and
`code-hygiene/VALIDATOR.md` derives the Go half the same way from the six sets a
`.go` file reaches.

The two Swift rules leave the key empty for the other reason the key admits:
each decides some BULLETS of a prompt rule rather than the whole of it.
`supersedes` names a whole rule and the engine skips that rule whole, so naming
one would take its other bullets out of every review the moment the tool is
installed. Each rule file states which bullets it decides and which prompt rules
hold them. A TOOL rule that supersedes nothing replaces no prompt rule
and degrades to no rule: a machine without the tool gets no answer to the
question rather than a worse one. A prompt rule never carries the key — the
engine reads `supersedes` on a rule that carries a `tool` block and nowhere
else.

The `tool` block keys:

- `run` — a shell script, the same way skills embed shell. Write the pipeline
  you would type in a terminal: the tool, piped through `jq`, `sed`, or
  `grep`. Select the findings this rule owns and shape them in the pipe.
  There is no mapping configuration — the pipe is the mapping.

  A pipe carries one trap, and it is how a rule answers zero for a broken tool.
  A shell pipeline takes the exit status of its LAST command, so a pipe that
  ends in `jq` exits 0 whatever the tool did. The engine reads exit 0 as "the
  tool judged the code", so a tool that refused to start reports as a clean
  file. Write a pipe only where the tool cannot exit nonzero. Otherwise write a
  script: run the tool into a file, test the status, and exit nonzero yourself.
  `rules/missing-docs-python.md` is the worked example, and its body states each
  status it read. Two more shapes of the same trap:

  - A tool can exit 0 for a file it could not open, and print an empty report.
    Test each file the script is given before the tool starts.
  - A `files`-scope script given NO file must report nothing and exit 0. The
    loop over `"$@"` is a no-op, so a tool handed no path falls back to a
    default target of its own and answers for the whole tree. Write these
    three lines:

        if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]; then
          exit 0
        fi

    Write them above every line that runs. Four kinds of line stand over
    them: a comment, a blank line, a shell option line and a shell setup
    line.

    A shell option line opens with `set` and it names one option or more,
    such as `set -e`, `set +e` or `set -euo pipefail`. Each word under `set`
    opens with `-` or `+` and holds shell option letters, or it is the name a
    long option takes, or it opens a comment. A `#` word and every word under
    it are a comment, so `set -e # keep going` stands over the guard. The
    letter `o` takes the name of a long option out of the WORD UNDER the one
    that writes it, wherever `o` stands in its own word, so a word takes one
    name for each `o` it writes. `set -o pipefail`, `set -euo pipefail` and
    `set -oe pipefail` therefore stand over the guard, and `set -oe`,
    `set -eo` and `set -euo` do not, because each of the three owes a name it
    never takes and the shell then writes the whole option table to stdout. A
    name can wear quotation marks, so `set -o "pipefail"` stands over the
    guard. A name that names no shell option does not, so `set -o rm`,
    `set -e pipefail` and `set pipefail` do not. A letter that names no shell
    option does not either, so `set -y` and `set -q` do not; and `set -n` does
    not, because it stops the shell from running any line at all. Three other
    `set` lines do not stand over the guard: `set` alone writes every shell
    variable, `set -o` alone writes every shell option, and a `set --` line
    writes the positional parameters that `$#` counts.

    A shell setup line opens with `:`, `alias`, `export`, `hash`, `readonly`,
    `shopt`, `trap`, `true`, `umask` or `unset`, or it writes shell variables
    and nothing else. `export LC_ALL=C`, `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`,
    `umask 022` and `trap 'exit 1' INT` each stand over the guard. `shift`
    does not, because it rewrites the positional parameters that `$#` counts.
    A variable a line writes IN FRONT OF a command runs that command, so
    `LC_ALL=C tool "$@"` does not stand over the guard either.

    A line that holds `;`, `&`, `|`, a backtick, `>`, `<` or `$(` runs a
    second command, or it reads or writes a file. A line that ends with a
    backslash joins the line under it. None of those lines stands over the
    guard. A guard under the first `mktemp -d` leaves a directory behind; a
    guard under the first tool call answers after the tool read the tree; and
    a guard in a subshell, in the body of a function or in a heredoc never
    runs. This text and this place ARE the contract: a coverage guard reads
    the shipped script of each `files`-scope rule and holds it to both.
    Another shape with the same behaviour, such as `[ "$#" -eq 0 ] && exit 0`,
    does not meet the contract.

    The shell is bash. `sah` runs every rule script with `bash -c`, and every
    measurement above was taken with bash. `sh` reads a script in POSIX mode,
    where a failed `set` line stops the whole run, so a shape measured under
    `sh` can answer another way.
  - A script that makes a temporary directory removes it. Write
    `work="$(mktemp -d)"`, then `trap 'rm -rf "$work"' EXIT` on the line
    directly under it. No line stands between the two, so no statement
    between them can exit and leave the directory. The trap covers a clean
    run, a run with findings and a broken run alike, and it leaves the exit
    status of the script alone. Write the same variable name in every rule,
    and name `mktemp` in `doctor.check_command`, because the script runs it.
- `scope` — `files` or `workspace`. With `files`, the script receives the
  changed files as its arguments (`"$@"`). With `workspace`, the script runs
  one time at the workspace root with no arguments (for example `cargo`), and
  the engine keeps only the findings in changed files. A `workspace` script
  therefore writes no `"$@"` and no zero-argument guard: it reads `$#` as 0
  on each run, so the guard would exit it before the tool starts and the rule
  would report nothing for any code. That is the whole reason a `workspace`
  rule stands outside the zero-argument guard. A coverage guard holds each
  `workspace`-scope rule to both statements, and a third guard holds the two
  scope rosters to the whole set of rules that carry a `run` script, so a
  rule cannot ship with a scope that no guard reads.
- `doctor` — the commands that show the script's tools are installed and show
  the main tool's version. Name everything the script needs (`which ruff jq`).
- `install.commands` — the install commands, in order of preference. Pin the
  tool version in each command. An unpinned tool can change its rules and
  break the gate. A tool that ships with the language toolchain has no package
  to pin (clippy is a `rustup` component), so its rule declares no install
  commands at all. An install command must also put the binary where
  `check_command` can find it, because `check_command` alone decides whether the
  install worked. `uv`, `pipx` and `npm install -g` write a directory a user
  PATH usually holds; a bare `go install` writes `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`, which
  a default PATH does not hold, so the Go rules state
  `GOBIN="$HOME/.local/bin"` and land the binary in the same directory `uv` and
  `pipx` use.
- `doctor.fix_hint` — the command a person runs when there is nothing to
  install. A toolchain component has no package version to pin, so its rule
  states `fix_hint: "rustup component add clippy"` and doctor reports that as
  the fix. A fix hint is text for a person. The install lifecycle never runs
  it, and it never enters `install.commands`.

The script's contract is its stdout. One finding per line, in either shape:

- `path:line: message` — the common linter line convention, easy to make
  with `sed` or `grep -n`.
- `{"file": ..., "line": ..., "message": ...}` — a JSON object per line,
  what `jq -c` emits.

Empty stdout means clean. Exit 0 means the script judged the code. A nonzero
exit means the script broke — its stderr goes to the diagnosing agent, and no
findings are read. A pipe that ends in `jq` or `sed` exits 0 even when the
linter before it exits 1 on findings; that is the behavior you want, so do
not add `pipefail` for linters that exit nonzero on findings.

A script that judged the code and could not judge ONE item says so on stderr,
on a line that opens `sah-diagnostic:`, and it still exits 0. The engine reads
each marked line and the report states it. Write one where the run is sound
and one thing inside it is not: a path no compile database covers, a manifest
the tool could not resolve, a configuration the tool read differently than the
rule asked for.

    printf 'sah-diagnostic: no compile database covers %s\n' "$file" >&2

Do not exit nonzero for a declined item. A nonzero exit fails the WHOLE run,
so one unjudged path throws away every finding the run did make. Do not stay
silent either: a run that reports no finding and exits 0 over an item it never
judged reads exactly like a clean pass over that item.

The marker is what makes the line a statement. Everything else a script writes
to stderr while exiting 0 is the tool's own chatter — progress, a deprecation
notice, a lock wait, a build script — and the engine drops it from the report.
That is why a script may forward a linter's raw stderr on the success path
without filling the report with it.

The same exit status hides a linter that BROKE. A linter can keep one status
for findings and another status for a failure, and the pipe drops both. So a
pipe is safe only where the tool exits nonzero for findings alone. Where the
tool has a failure status of its own, run it into a file, test the status
against the findings status, and exit nonzero yourself.

One status can carry both a measured run and a broken run. The status of a
failure is then the same as the status of a finding. The script must then test
the REPORT beside the status, and accept the shared status only for the report
shape a measured run writes. Measured with swiftlint 0.65.0: a run that
breaches `warning_threshold:` exits 2 and writes a JSON array that holds one
entry for each finding and one entry more for the threshold — 2 entries over
the magic-numbers fixture and 3 over the missing-docs fixture; a run beside a
project `swiftlint_version:` that names a version that is not installed exits
2, writes 0 bytes and lints no file. The four shipped
swiftlint rules accept status 2 only when the report holds a JSON array of one
entry or more. A script that accepted every status 2 reported 0 findings and
exited 0 for the second shape, and the engine read a dirty file as clean.

A failure status and a clean answer can share a report of 0 bytes. The script
must then test STDERR, and answer clean for the shape stderr names. Measured
with swiftlint 0.65.0: a project `.swiftlint.yml` that holds `excluded: [src]`
makes swiftlint write `Error: No lintable files found at paths:
'src/Magic.swift'` to stderr, write 0 bytes to stdout, and exit 1. Each of the
four shipped swiftlint rules tests stderr for `No lintable files found` after
the status gate, and each exits 0 with no finding for that shape. Measured over
four dirty fixtures beside that project file: each of the four reported 0
findings at exit 0. A script without the stderr test answers a tool error for
each project `excluded:` list.

That answer judged NO file, so each of the three states every path of the run
under the marker before it exits. A sound run writes 0 bytes to stderr —
measured with swiftlint 0.65.0 over one dirty file with no project
configuration — so the whole channel is free to carry the statement. Measured
over one dirty file beside `excluded: [Generated]`: 0 findings, exit 0, and one
marked line that names the path.

Selection in the pipe is attribution, not exemption. Some tools cannot run
one check alone — `cargo clippy -- -W missing_docs` emits its whole lint set.
The `jq 'select(...)'` or `grep` in your pipe says which findings this rule
owns; the rest are dropped, not reported. To exempt one code item, use an
inline suppression in the code — never the pipe.

Rules for tool rules:

- A finding from a tool is a requirement. Fix it or suppress it in code.
- Exemptions live in the tool configuration or in an inline suppression
  (for example `#[allow(missing_docs)]`, `# noqa`). They do not live in prose.
- **An exemption a person would argue for in prose must become an inline
  suppression the tool reads.** A prompt rule can carve out a case by describing
  it; a tool rule cannot, and it must not try. Turn the argument into a marker in
  the code, and state the marker in the rule body.

  Staged work is the canonical example. A prompt rule can say "exempt a symbol a
  later task will consume", and then every reader decides for themselves what
  counts. A tool rule says instead: write
  `#[expect(dead_code, reason = "...")]`, or `//lint:ignore U1000 <reason>`, or
  `// ts-prune-ignore-next`, or `# noqa: V103`, or `// ignore: unused_element`,
  or `// periphery:ignore`. The marker is the claim, the reason names the change
  that lands the consumer, and a symbol with neither is dead. That converts a
  judgment into a fact, which is the whole point of a tool rule.

  Prefer a marker that expires. Rust's `#[expect]` raises
  `unfulfilled_lint_expectations` the moment the consumer lands, so the
  annotation cleans itself up; `#[allow]` never does. Where the language offers
  both, the rule body names the expiring one.
- When a tool needs a configuration file, the `run` script writes one to a
  temporary path and passes it with a flag — the script owns its whole
  invocation, config included. Never change the project's own lint
  configuration.
- A tool with no configuration flag reads its configuration from the directory
  tree around the file it examines. The script then builds that tree: it makes
  a temporary package, writes the configuration into it, copies the changed
  files in, runs the tool on the package, and maps the temporary paths back to
  the paths it was given. `dart analyze` works this way. The script writes the
  configuration of that tree itself, and it copies no configuration of the
  project's own into the tree.
- A script MAY read the project's own configuration for the FILE LIST alone,
  and only where the tool merges two configurations and lets the script's own
  one win. Which files a linter passes over — a generated tree, a vendored
  tree — is the project's decision and belongs in the project's file. What the
  rule MEASURES is the rule's decision. The four shipped swiftlint rules do
  this: each names the project's `.swiftlint.yml` as the PARENT config and its
  own temporary file as the CHILD, and passes `--force-exclude` so the
  project's `excluded:` list reaches a file named on the command line.

  A script that reads the project's configuration must state EVERY option of
  EVERY rule it measures with, in its own child configuration, and the rule
  body must carry a measurement of a project configuration that states other
  options. Without that, a project silently changes the gate. Measured with
  swiftlint 0.65.0: a parent stating `missing_docs: excludes_inherited_types:
  false` moves the count when the child states no `missing_docs:` block, and it
  moves nothing when the child states the block.

### Fixtures

Each tool rule ships two fixture files in the set's `fixtures/` directory:

- `fixtures/<name>.fail.<ext>.tmpl` — the tool must report at least one finding.
- `fixtures/<name>.pass.<ext>.tmpl` — the tool must report zero findings.

**A fixture is a template, and its stored name ends in `.tmpl`.** A fixture
carries the very defect its rule reports. Stored under a real source extension
it is a file the review engine reviews, so the missing-docs rule fires on the
fixture built to make it fire, and the two demands cannot both be met. No
language owns `.tmpl` and no file group matches it, so the stored file is
never reviewed and never linted. Every file in `fixtures/` takes the suffix,
support files included.

The two fixtures must cover the same kinds. The fail fixture holds one
undocumented item of every kind the pass fixture documents — the type, the
class, the interface, the enumeration, the method, and the function. A pass
fixture that documents six kinds against a fail fixture that holds only a
function proves nothing about the other five: a tool that stops reporting a
whole kind still passes that pair.

Doctor copies `fixtures/` into a scratch directory, drops the `.tmpl` suffix
from every name, and runs there — so the tool sees `missing-docs-rust.fail.rs`
even though the set stores `missing-docs-rust.fail.rs.tmpl`. The set's own
directory is never the working directory, so a tool that writes beside its
input cannot dirty the repository. A `files`-scope script gets the
materialized fixture file name as its argument; a `workspace`-scope script
gets none. Doctor counts only the
findings the run reports ABOUT the fixture under test — the same attribution
the engine makes when it keeps only the findings in the changed files. A
`workspace`-scope script reads the whole `fixtures/` directory on both runs, so
without that attribution it could never pass the pair.

A tool that needs more than a loose file to run gets it in `fixtures/`. Cargo
lints a package, never a loose file, so the `code-hygiene` fixtures carry a
`Cargo.toml.tmpl` and a crate root that hold every Rust fixture as a module. A
`go.mod.tmpl`, a `tsconfig.json.tmpl` and a `Package.swift.tmpl` do the same for
staticcheck, ts-prune and periphery. The whole directory is materialized, not
only the fixture under test, so a `workspace`-scope tool finds those neighbours.

Only the top level of `fixtures/` is copied, so a manifest has to reach its
fixtures without a source directory: the Swift manifest names `path: "."` and
lists its `sources`, and the crate root uses `#[path = "..."]`. Each manifest
names its own rule's fixtures and no others, so one rule's fixtures cannot move
another rule's result.

A tool rule that fails its fixtures is not used, and doctor reports it.
Fixtures catch a tool upgrade that changes behavior.

## Install lifecycle

When a review needs a tool rule and the tool is missing:

1. Doctor runs `check_command`. If it passes, the tool rule is ready.
2. The engine tries each entry in `install.commands`, in order. After each try,
   doctor runs again.
3. If every command fails, an install agent gets the rule, the platform, and
   the error output. The agent has one goal: make `check_command` pass.
   Doctor confirms the result — the agent cannot assert success.
4. If the tool is still missing, the superseded prompt rule runs instead, and
   doctor keeps a warning. A missing tool degrades the review. It never blocks
   the review.

`sah init` runs steps 1 and 2 for every tool rule of the detected project
types, so the tools are already there the first time a review needs them. It
never runs step 3 — install never spends an agent turn. A tool `sah init`
could not install is a warning that names the rule, never an error.

One install runs at a time. An exclusive lock covers steps 2 and 3 together,
so two installers never write one destination at once. A process that waits out
the lock installs nothing and reports the tool blocked, which lands on step 4:
the superseded prompt rule runs. The lock covers the processes that share one
temporary directory, which on a machine that gives each user a temporary
directory of its own means one user. Homebrew locks its own shared prefix.
`npm install -g` under a Homebrew node writes that shared prefix and takes
neither lock; two users installing at that moment are not serialized.

## Doctor

The review engine is doctorable. `sah doctor` reports, for this project:

- The detected project types.
- Each validator set, and whether it applies to this project.
- Each tool rule for the detected project types: tool present or missing, tool
  version, fixture result.
- Each tool rule on its prompt fallback because its tool is missing, with the
  install commands to fix it, or with the `doctor.fix_hint` when the rule
  declares no install commands.

Run `sah doctor` after install, and again when review behavior changes.

## Customize and override

Validators resolve with this precedence — **later wins**:

    built-in (shipped in sah)  <  user (~/.validators/)  <  this project (./.validators/)

A set or rule in this folder therefore overrides a user-level or built-in one
of the same name, and anything you add here is picked up immediately. Prompt
rules and tool rules override the same way — a rule is a rule.

- **Add your own** — create `./.validators/<set>/VALIDATOR.md` (and `rules/`).
  Validators you add are never touched by `sah init`.
- **Replace a built-in** — give your set or rule the same name as a built-in;
  yours wins by the precedence above.

`sah init` refreshes the built-in validator files on every run but leaves your
own files in place, so keep your changes as your own named set or rule so they
always persist.

## What `sah deinit` removes

`sah deinit` clears this store. It removes every validator set the directory
holds — the built-in sets, a set an older version of `sah` wrote, and a set you
wrote yourself. The store serves `sah` alone, so the validators go when `sah`
goes. A set is a subdirectory with a `VALIDATOR.md`, and `sah deinit` removes
each such subdirectory whole, so a rule you added inside a built-in set goes
with that set.

Anything in this directory that is not a validator set stays: a loose file
beside the set directories, and a directory with no `VALIDATOR.md`. Each such
file keeps this directory itself in place.

Copy a set you want to keep to another directory before you run `sah deinit`.
