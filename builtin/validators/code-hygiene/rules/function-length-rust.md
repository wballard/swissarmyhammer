# Function Length — Rust

`clippy::too_many_lines` reports every function that runs too long, and
`too-many-lines-threshold` is the one threshold it reads.

Every measurement below was made with clippy 0.1.97 and cargo 1.97.1.

## The metric IS the prompt rule's own count

`function-length` counts "250 lines of actual code", and it states the count in
two lines: "Exclude blank lines and comment-only lines" and "Measure from
opening brace to closing brace". `too_many_lines` counts the same lines: it
walks the body and it skips a blank line and a comment-only line. Measured over
one function that holds 300 blank lines, 300 comment-only lines and 3 code
lines, against the gate of 250: no finding.

So the gate carries the prompt rule's own number with no derivation, which is
the shape `function-length-dart` takes for the same reason. `function-length-go`
and `function-length-python` each derive a number instead, because each of those
counts STATEMENTS rather than lines.

## The corpus the gate was measured over

Five well-known Rust repositories, cloned at HEAD on 2026-08-15:

| repository | commit |
|---|---|
| BurntSushi/ripgrep | `3fce3b5bb0236da2df6d99672afb8a719642eca7` |
| serde-rs/serde | `747814f7d5fbab872df3b02f070c165b91bde062` |
| tokio-rs/tokio | `625954f365727668cb02d04172b34f1149637728` |
| serde-rs/json | `afdf6fc67247dd7fa4fcde1381e6ecc6bcc7a30e` |
| chronotope/chrono | `6adaa5240c26fecb7bd9077334a91f8f67f4f3fe` |

1232 `.rs` files. Each repository was run one time at
`too-many-lines-threshold = 1`, which makes clippy report every function and
print that function's own line count in its message —
`this function has too many lines (411/1)`. 6660 functions came back with their
own number, so every sweep below is arithmetic on the tool's own count rather
than on a model of it.

| `too-many-lines-threshold` | findings | under `#[test]` | in a `tests/` path |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | 24 | 12 | 2 |
| 150 | 6 | 2 | 1 |
| 200 | 3 | 1 | 1 |
| 250 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| 300 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 500 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

At the gate of 250 the corpus reports two functions:

- `chrono/src/format/parse.rs:1093` `test_parse_fixed_timezone_offset`, 411
  lines, carrying `#[test]`.
- `tokio/tokio/src/runtime/tests/task_combinations.rs:157` `test_combination`,
  252 lines, carrying no attribute at all. It is a helper the prompt rule lists,
  and the section "A test, which the run does not drop" below states why the run
  reports it.

The sweep is flat above 250 and it climbs fast below it, so the prompt rule's
own number sits where the corpus separates a long procedure from ordinary code.

On this repository the same gate reports 4 functions, and the raw report holds 7
lines for them.

## How the run is shaped

The script writes a `clippy.toml` into a temporary directory and points
`CLIPPY_CONF_DIR` at that directory. `too-many-lines-threshold` is the whole
configuration this lint has: clippy prints its full key list for a key it does
not know, and no other key in that list names `too_many_lines`. The list holds
nine keys whose name ends in `-in-tests`, among them `allow-unwrap-in-tests` and
`allow-panic-in-tests`, and none of the nine names this lint. So no key carves
out a test, and no key carves out a data line. The section "The carve-outs the
prompt rule states" below states what answers each carve-out instead.

`CLIPPY_CONF_DIR` was measured before the rule relied on it. A configuration
directory holding a raised threshold silences the lint on a probe crate that
trips it at the gate, so clippy reads the file. A package carrying its own
`clippy.toml` still reports when `CLIPPY_CONF_DIR` names the gate, so the
variable wins and the project's own file is never read. A cached second run
re-emits the warnings, so a repeated review still reports.

The `trap` removes the temporary directory when the script exits. It covers a
clean run, a run with findings and a broken run alike, and it leaves the exit
status of the script alone.

The scope is `workspace` because cargo lints a package, never a loose file. The
engine keeps only the findings in the changed files. The script therefore writes
no `"$@"` and no zero-argument guard, which is what that scope asks of it.

`--all-targets` lints the library target and the test targets separately, so one
function in one file arrives twice. Measured over one function of 302 lines: the
raw report held it two times, and `sort -u` collapsed them to one. On this
repository the raw report held 7 lines for 4 distinct findings.

`too_many_lines` also fires on generated code that cargo writes under `OUT_DIR`,
which arrives as an absolute path and is not editable. The
`select(.file | startswith("/") | not)` step drops it. Four such files were
measured on this repository: the generated accessor of `mirdan`, of
`swissarmyhammer-skills`, of `swissarmyhammer-templating` and of
`swissarmyhammer-validators`.

The run uses `-W`, never `--force-warn`. `too_many_lines` stands in clippy's
`pedantic` group, which is allow by default, so `-W` is what turns it on at all.
Measured over one function of 302 lines: the run without `-W` reported nothing
and the run with it reported the function. No crate of this repository carries
an inline `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` or a crate-level `#![allow]` for
it, so `-W` reaches every function that has not been exempted on purpose.

The `jq` filter selects the one lint code and drops every other lint clippy
emits. Selection here is attribution, not exemption: to exempt one function,
write the annotation the section below states.

The rule declares no install commands. Clippy is a component of the Rust
toolchain, not a package with its own version, so no install command can pin it.
The `doctor.fix_hint` states `rustup component add clippy` instead, which
installs it for the toolchain the project already uses. `sah doctor` shows that
hint as the fix; the install lifecycle never runs it.

## A workspace the tool cannot lint

`cargo clippy` exits nonzero for four different reasons, and one status carries
all four:

- cargo could not start a run at all.
- cargo made a run, and a crate failed its type check. Clippy runs the lint
  AFTER that type check, so it never linted that crate.
- cargo made a run, and the BUILD SCRIPT of a crate broke. cargo runs a build
  script before it compiles the crate that script serves, so clippy never linted
  that crate. This repository holds fifteen build scripts.
- cargo made a run, clippy linted every crate, and a lint stands at deny level.

The first three are broken runs. The fourth is a MEASURED run, and the findings
it holds must stand. `builtin/validators/README.md` states the answer for this
shape: "One status can carry both a measured run and a broken run. The status of
a failure is then the same as the status of a finding. The script must then test
the REPORT beside the status, and accept the shared status only for the report
shape a measured run writes." The four shipped swiftlint rules make the same
test.

The FILTERED findings answer none of the four. One member that compiles fills
that file while another member never reached the lint, so a workspace with a
broken member reads as a clean tree. The script therefore reads the RAW report,
which carries what the filter drops. Three entries of it answer the question.

**`{"reason":"build-finished"}`.** cargo writes this entry for every run it
made, and no entry at all for a run it could not make. Measured over the 19
shapes below: a healthy run writes `{"reason":"build-finished","success":true}`;
every nonzero shape cargo made writes
`{"reason":"build-finished","success":false}`, the three deny-level shapes
included; a directory with no `Cargo.toml`, a `Cargo.toml` that does not parse
and a target directory cargo cannot write each write 0 bytes and no entry. So
the PRESENCE of the entry states that cargo ran, and the `success` field states
nothing the exit status does not.

**A rustc error code.** A crate that fails its type check writes a
`compiler-message` at level `error` whose code is a rustc code such as `E0308`,
and a crate that fails to parse writes one with NO code. A lint at deny level
writes a `compiler-message` at level `error` whose code is the LINT name, such
as `clippy::unwrap_used` or `unused_variables`. Measured: no error-level message
of any deny-level shape carries a rustc code or an empty code, and no
error-level message of any healthy shape stands at all.

**A build script cargo compiled and never ran.** cargo writes one
`compiler-artifact` entry whose `target.kind` holds `custom-build` for every
build script it COMPILED, and one `build-script-executed` entry for every build
script it RAN. A build script that breaks leaves the first entry standing and
the second one out. Measured over one package that holds a build script which
breaks: the whole report ran 1133 bytes, and it held one `build-finished` entry
with `success: false`, one `custom-build` artifact, no `build-script-executed`
entry and NO `compiler-message` at all. The control, the same package under
`fn main() {}`, ran 7489 bytes and held one `build-script-executed` entry beside
its artifact. So the two entries state which build scripts ran, and cargo writes
no compiler error for this failure at all.

The pair reads a cached run the same way. Measured over one package that holds a
build script beside a path dependency that holds another: the first run wrote
two `custom-build` artifacts and two `build-script-executed` entries, and a
second run over a warm target directory, whose artifacts arrived `fresh: true`,
wrote the same two entries. Over this repository the run wrote 149 `custom-build`
artifacts and 149 `build-script-executed` entries, so no build script stands
unrun.

The script breaks the run in four places, and writes its own line for each one:

- the status is nonzero and the raw report holds no `build-finished` entry —
  `function-length-rust: cargo could not run clippy over the workspace`;
- the raw report holds an error-level message with a rustc code or with no code
  — `function-length-rust: cargo clippy could not lint the workspace`;
- the raw report holds a `custom-build` artifact whose package writes no
  `build-script-executed` entry —
  `function-length-rust: a build script did not run, so clippy did not lint every crate`;
- the status is nonzero and the raw report holds no error-level message at all
  — `function-length-rust: cargo stopped the build and wrote no compiler error`.

The last two both answer a build script that breaks, and the build-script test
stands first because it names the cause. The two are not one test. Measured with
the build-script test taken out of the script: the fourth test broke the
one-package shape and the two-member shape, and the two-member shape BESIDE a
lint at deny level still wrote `good/src/lib.rs:2` and exited 0, because the
denied lint fills the report with an error-level message. Measured with the
fourth test taken out: the build-script test broke all three. So each test
answers a shape the other one lets through.

Every other run writes the findings it holds and exits 0. cargo's own stderr
reaches the diagnosing agent beside the rule's line.

Each package that holds a finding holds one function whose body runs 300 lines,
which clippy counts as 300 against the gate of 250.

| the shape | status | `build-finished` | error codes | the run answers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| a healthy package, one finding | 0 | `success: true` | none | 1 finding, exit 0 |
| a healthy package, no finding | 0 | `success: true` | none | 0 findings, exit 0 |
| `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]` beside one `unwrap`, one finding | 101 | `success: false` | `clippy::unwrap_used` | 1 finding, exit 0 |
| `[lints.clippy] unwrap_used = "deny"` beside one `unwrap`, one finding | 101 | `success: false` | `clippy::unwrap_used` | 1 finding, exit 0 |
| `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]` beside one `unwrap`, no finding | 101 | `success: false` | `clippy::unwrap_used` | 0 findings, exit 0 |
| `[lints.clippy] unwrap_used = "deny"` beside one `unwrap`, no finding | 101 | `success: false` | `clippy::unwrap_used` | 0 findings, exit 0 |
| `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"` beside one `unused_variables`, one finding | 101 | `success: false` | `unused_variables` | 1 finding, exit 0 |
| `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"` beside one `unused_variables`, no finding | 101 | `success: false` | `unused_variables` | 0 findings, exit 0 |
| a package that does not compile: `pub fn broken() -> i32 { "not an integer" }` | 101 | `success: false` | `E0308` | 0 findings, exit 1 |
| a package that does not parse: `pub fn broken( {` | 101 | `success: false` | no code | 0 findings, exit 1 |
| a workspace of two members, one that does not compile and one that gives a finding | 101 | `success: false` | `E0308` | 0 findings, exit 1 |
| a directory that holds no `Cargo.toml` | 101 | none, 0 bytes | none | 0 findings, exit 1 |
| a `Cargo.toml` that does not parse | 101 | none, 0 bytes | none | 0 findings, exit 1 |
| a target directory cargo cannot write | 101 | none, 0 bytes | none | 0 findings, exit 1 |
| `jq` replaced by a command that exits 127 | 0 | `success: true` | none | 0 findings, exit 1 |
| a package whose build script breaks | 101 | `success: false` | none | 0 findings, exit 1 |
| a package whose build script runs, one finding | 0 | `success: true` | none | 1 finding, exit 0 |
| a workspace of two members, one whose build script breaks and one that gives a finding | 101 | `success: false` | none | 0 findings, exit 1 |
| the same workspace beside `[workspace.lints.clippy] unwrap_used = "deny"` | 101 | `success: false` | `clippy::unwrap_used` | 0 findings, exit 1 |

cargo writes `error: could not compile` to stderr for every nonzero row it
reached, the deny-level rows included, and `error: failed to run custom build
command` for the build-script rows, so stderr tells a reader nothing the raw
report does not. Under `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"` the lint arrives at level
`error` rather than `warning`; the filter selects on the lint CODE, so the
findings stand either way.

The two-member row is the shape the `scope: workspace` of this rule makes reach
a real repository, and this repository holds more than 20 members. Measured over
that row with an earlier gate, which read the FILTERED findings file: the member
`good` wrote `good/src/lib.rs:1`, that file was not empty, the status test never
ran, and the long function of `bad/src/lib.rs` was read as clean.

The same earlier gate broke the two clean deny-level rows: a workspace clippy
linted from end to end, holding a lint at deny level and no finding of the gate,
wrote the broken-run line and exited 1.

The three build-script rows that break are the shape the fifteen build scripts
of this repository make reach it. Measured over each of them with the earlier
gate, which read the compiler messages alone: the one-package row wrote 0
findings and exited 0 while its control wrote `src/lib.rs:1`; the two-member row
wrote `good/src/lib.rs:1` alone; and the two-member row beside the denied lint
wrote `good/src/lib.rs:2` alone. In each of the three the long function of the
crate that never reached the lint was read as clean.

## The status of each step

An earlier shape of this script was one pipe that ended in `sort -u`. A shell
pipeline takes the status of its last command, and the script writes `set -e`
with no `pipefail`, so that shape answered exit 0 for every broken run. Measured
over the package that does not compile: the pipe wrote 0 findings and exited 0,
and the engine read the whole tree as clean, the function of 302 lines included.

Each step therefore writes to a file and tests its own status. The script calls
`jq` five times — one call for the `build-finished` entry, one for the rustc
error codes, one for the error-level messages, one for the build scripts that
never ran, and one for the findings — and each call carries the same test: a
status other than 0 writes `function-length-rust: jq could not read the clippy
report` to stderr and exits 1. Measured over the healthy package, which gives
one finding, with `jq` replaced by a command that exits 127: the pipe shape
wrote 0 findings and exited 0; the shipped shape writes 0 findings, that line,
and exit 1.

`sort -u` reads the file the filter step wrote, so it stands last with no pipe
above it and the script takes its status.

## The annotation an author writes

Write `#[expect(clippy::too_many_lines, reason = "...")]` on the function a
finding reports:

    /// Every default this crate ships.
    #[expect(clippy::too_many_lines, reason = "one line for each field")]
    fn default() -> Self {

`#[expect]` is the marker, not `#[allow]`, because `#[expect]` expires by
itself. Measured over one function of 302 lines and one function of 100 lines
against the gate of 250: the annotation on the first is silent, and the
annotation on the second raises `unfulfilled_lint_expectations`. So the compiler
asks for the annotation back the moment the function drops under the gate.
`#[allow]` never does.

Measured over one function of 302 lines against the gate of 250. Each of these
spellings gives no finding:

- `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` on the function.
- `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines, reason = "a flat field list")]` on the
  function.
- `#[expect(clippy::too_many_lines, reason = "a flat field list")]` on the
  function.
- `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` on the `impl` block that holds the method.
- `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` on the `mod` that holds the function,
  inline or as an out-of-line declaration.
- `#![allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` as the FIRST line of the function body.

Each of these spellings gives one finding:

- `// clippy: allow too_many_lines because it is data`, or any other comment.
  Clippy reads no comment directive.
- `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` on the `macro_rules!` item that expands the
  function, and the same annotation on the macro invocation. The second one also
  raises `unused_attributes`.

`#[allow(too_many_lines)]`, with no `clippy::` in front of it, silences the
finding and raises `renamed_and_removed_lints`, which states the bare name may
stop working. Write the `clippy::` name.

`#![allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` below the first line of a function body is a
compile error: `an inner attribute is not permitted in this context`.

The first fix a finding asks for is still to split the function. The annotation
is the second fix, and its `reason` states why.

## The carve-outs the prompt rule states

`function-length` exempts four shapes: a test, generated code, a function that
is mostly configuration or data, and an initialization function that sets many
fields. The run reproduces the generated code cargo writes under `OUT_DIR`. The
author answers every other one with the annotation above.

### Configuration, data, a builder and an initializer, which the run does not drop

`function-length` exempts "Functions that are mostly configuration/data (e.g.,
builder patterns with many options)" and "Initialization functions that set many
fields". Clippy counts a data line like a code line, and its configuration holds
no key that tells the two apart.

Measured over three functions of 302 lines each, at the gate of 250:

| the shape | `too_many_lines` |
|---|---|
| a `Config::default()` that sets 300 fields | 302/250 |
| a builder chain of 300 `.opt(n)` calls, one for each line | 302/250 |
| a `vec![]` of 300 entries | 302/250 |

So a data function REPORTS, and the author answers it. The first answer is to
move the data out of the function — a `const` table, a `Default` derive, a
smaller builder. The second answer is
`#[expect(clippy::too_many_lines, reason = "...")]` on the function, with the
reason naming the data. `function-length-go` and `function-length-python` each
record the same verdict for the initializer, and the Go statement gate drops the
data shapes for itself because a composite literal is one statement.

### A test, which the run does not drop

`function-length` exempts "Functions explicitly marked as tests", and this set
names the DEFINITION as the mark: identify a test from its attribute or
framework naming convention at the definition, never from the file name. A
complex helper named `build_request` in a file called `foo_test.rs` is still a
long function and is still listed.

Rust states that convention in `#[test]`, and clippy holds no flag and no
configuration key that reads it. Its whole key list carries nine `-in-tests`
keys, and none of the nine names `too_many_lines`.

`--all-targets` is what puts test code in front of the gate, and it is the flag,
not a carve-out, that decides. Measured over one package holding a long function
in the library, a long `#[test]` function inside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`, a
long function in `tests/it.rs` and a long function in `examples/ex.rs`:

| the run | the files reported |
|---|---|
| with `--all-targets` | `src/lib.rs` two times, `tests/it.rs`, `examples/ex.rs` |
| without `--all-targets` | `src/lib.rs` one time, the library function alone |

The rule keeps `--all-targets`. Dropping it reads the TARGET, which is the mark
the prompt rule forbids: it silences a long helper in `tests/it.rs` beside the
test that calls it, it silences an example and a benchmark, which are ordinary
code, and it drops every `#[cfg(test)]` module because `cfg(test)` is then off.
That trades true findings for the carve-out, which is the trade
`function-length-python` refuses for a test path.

The corpus states what the trade costs. At the gate of 250 the corpus reports
2 functions, 1 of them under `#[test]`, and the other one is
`tokio` `test_combination` — a 252-line helper in a `tests/` directory that
carries no attribute, which is the shape the prompt rule lists. A carve-out
reading the path would have dropped both.

So a long test function REPORTS, and the author answers it. One
`#[expect(clippy::too_many_lines, reason = "...")]` on `mod tests` covers every
function of the module — measured, an annotation on a `mod` silences the
functions inside it.

### Generated code, and a macro expansion

Rust states no generated-file header convention, and clippy reads no header.
Measured over one file whose head carries `// This file is @generated by
prost-build.` and `// Code generated by tool. DO NOT EDIT.`: it reported its
function, the same as the plain file beside it. A header test in the script
would name the first lines of one generator and never a convention, so this rule
states none. The sibling `function-length-go` does make such a test, because Go
states one convention.

Generated Rust arrives in three shapes, and each has its own answer.

- **Written under `OUT_DIR` and pulled in with `include!`.** The path is
  absolute and the file is not editable. The
  `select(.file | startswith("/") | not)` step drops it. Measured over one probe
  crate whose `build.rs` writes a function of 302 lines: the report named the
  file under `target/debug/build/.../out/out.rs` by an absolute path.
- **Checked in and named by a `mod` declaration.** The path is relative and the
  file reports. The author writes
  `#[expect(clippy::too_many_lines, reason = "...")]` on the `mod` declaration,
  which stands in the PARENT file and which the generator never writes again.
  Measured: the annotation on `pub mod generated;` silenced every finding of
  `src/generated.rs`, and the same annotation over a module file that no longer
  trips raised `unfulfilled_lint_expectations`.
- **Expanded from a macro.** `too_many_lines` reports one at the line of the
  macro DEFINITION rather than at the invocation. The one annotation that
  silences it is the one the macro body expands: measured,
  `#[expect(clippy::too_many_lines, reason = "...")]` written above
  `pub fn $name()` inside the macro is silent, the same annotation above the
  `macro_rules!` item leaves the finding standing, and the same annotation above
  the invocation leaves it standing and raises `unused_attributes`.
