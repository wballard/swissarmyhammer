//!
//! The build script ([`build.rs`]) embeds every file under `builtin/validators/`
//! — each set's `VALIDATOR.md`, its `rules/*.md`, and its tool-rule fixtures in
//! whatever language the tool lints — as `(name, content)` tuples, where `name`
//! is the path relative to `builtin/validators/` with its real filename
//! preserved (e.g. `dead-code/VALIDATOR.md`, `dead-code/rules/dead-code.md`,
//! `code-hygiene/fixtures/missing-docs-rust.fail.rs.tmpl`).
//!
//! This mirrors how `swissarmyhammer-skills` embeds `builtin/skills/`: the
//! profile installer materializes these onto disk in the validators store
//! (`~/.validators/` global or `./.validators/` project) so users can read,
//! learn from, and copy them. The validator *loader* still
//! reads the embedded set at lowest precedence; this on-disk copy is the
