//! Coverage guard: each shipped rule that carries a `run` script stands in
//! one of the two scope rosters, and the two rosters together are the whole
//! set.
//!
//! `scope` states which inputs the script receives, and it takes one of two
//! values. `files` hands the script the changed files as its arguments.
//! `workspace` hands the script no argument at all: [`script_args`] answers
//! an empty list for that scope, and the engine keeps the findings in the
//! changed files after the run.
//!
//! One roster stands for each value, and one guard stands for each roster.
//! `zero_argument` pins the `files` roster and holds each script of it to the
//! three lines the README states. Before this module, nothing read the
//! `workspace` roster, and nothing stated that the two rosters together are
//! the whole set. A rule that shipped with a `tool` block and a
//! `scope: workspace` therefore reached no guard: the `files` roster kept its
//! count, `temp_directory` read the rule only when the script called
//! `mktemp -d`, and the acceptance test of that rule is written by hand or
//! absent.
//!
//! This module closes that gap with three assertions.
//!
//! 1. The two rosters together count every rule that carries a `run` script,
//!    so a rule outside both breaks a test rather than shipping unread.
//! 2. No `workspace` script holds the zero-argument guard. This states WHY
//!    the `workspace` roster stands outside `zero_argument` rather than
//!    leaving the reason unwritten. A `workspace` script reads `$#` as 0 on
//!    each run, so the guard exits the script before the tool starts, and the
//!    rule then reports nothing for any code.
//! 3. No `workspace` script reads the argument list. The engine fills that
//!    list for a `files` script alone, so the name reads as empty and the
//!    line it stands on runs over nothing.
//!
//! This module reads the SHIPPED script of each rule, so the contract is held
//! for the rules that ship today and for the rules that ship next.
