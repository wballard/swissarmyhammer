# Magic Numbers — Swift

`swiftlint` reports every unnamed numeric literal. The `no_magic_numbers` rule
names that check. It is opt-in, so it never runs unless a configuration turns it
on.

The rule is already close to the `magic-numbers` prompt carve-outs. Measured
against a probe file holding one literal of each kind, it reported nothing for a
variable declaration, a stored property, a `static let`, an enumeration raw value,
or a default parameter — each of those declarations names its value. `100` is
absent too, which is the prompt carve-out for percent.

`allowed_numbers` is the one threshold the rule sets. The swiftlint default is
`[0.0, 1.0, 100.0]`, which is the prompt carve-out list without `-1`, so the
config states `[0, 1, -1, 100]` and the two lists then agree. `magic-numbers-go`
and `magic-numbers-typescript` state the same four values in their own
allow-lists.

## The shift carve-out is expressed, and Swift alone expresses it

The prompt rule names two conventional values, and this rule restores both.
`100` for percent is a VALUE, so `allowed_numbers` states it. A `<< 8` is a
POSITION — the operand of a shift — and no value allow-list can state a
position. `magic-numbers-go` and `magic-numbers-typescript` each record that
their own list cannot: a list carrying `8` silences a genuine `status == 8`
beside `word << 8`, which trades a real finding for a carve-out.

swiftlint answers it without the list, because `no_magic_numbers` reads the
OPERATOR. Measured on swiftlint 0.65.0 against the shipped
`allowed_numbers: [0, 1, -1, 100]`: `return word << 8` and `return word >> 8`
report nothing, and `return status == 8` reports
`Magic numbers should be replaced by named constants`. Both operands are carved
out, so `return 4096 << width` is silent as well.

The carve-out is the shift operator and nothing else. Measured in one identical
shape, `return word <operator> 8`: `<<` and `>>` are silent, and `&<<` — the
masking shift — `*`, `+`, `&`, `|`, `^` and `==` each report their `8`.

So `8` stays OUT of `allowed_numbers`. The carve-out is already reached, and
adding `8` would buy nothing and lose `status == 8`.

### The carve-out reaches a whole shift, not a link of a longer chain

The carve-out holds when the shift is the WHOLE expression at its position. It
does not reach a shift that stands as one link of a longer unparenthesised
operator chain, because swiftlint then reads the chain rather than a shift.
Measured on the same probe against the same config:

| Written | Reported |
|---|---|
| `return word << 8` | no |
| `let packed = word << 8` | no |
| `schedule(value: word << 8)` | no |
| `acc = (word << 8)` | no |
| `return (word << 8) \| 1` | no |
| `if (word << 8) > 0` | no |
| `acc = word << 8` | yes |
| `return word << 8 \| 1` | yes |
| `if word << 8 > 0` | yes |
| `return flag ? word << 8 : word` | yes |

Two recourses answer the four that report, and both are measured. Parentheses
around the shift silence every one of them, and that is the clearer code
besides. The other is the inline suppression at the end of this file: write
`// swiftlint:disable:next no_magic_numbers` above the line, with the reason
after it, which silenced `return word << 8 | 1`.

No option answers the rest. `swiftlint rules no_magic_numbers` names the whole
set the rule accepts — `severity`, `test_parent_classes` and `allowed_numbers`.
None of the three names a shift, and a fourth key is refused: an added
`allowed_shifts` makes swiftlint answer `Configuration for 'no_magic_numbers'
rule contains the invalid key(s) 'allowed_shifts'.` and read it no further.

Both halves are held by fixtures. The pass fixture carries `return word << 8`
and `return word >> 8`, so a swiftlint release that dropped the carve-out makes
the fixture pair fail and the doctor mark the rule unusable. The fail fixture
carries `return word << 8 | 1`, and the acceptance test
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_reports_every_fail_fixture_line`
holds swiftlint to reporting it, so the edge stays measured.

## How the run is shaped

The script names TWO configuration files. swiftlint reads a list of `--config`
paths as a parent-child hierarchy. The four shipped swiftlint rules share this
shape, and `missing-docs-swift` states each measurement behind it.

- The PARENT is the project's own `.swiftlint.yml` at the repository root. The
  script names it only when the file is there, because a `--config` path that
  holds no file aborts swiftlint. The parent gives the run the project's
  `excluded:` list.
- The CHILD is the file the script writes into a temporary directory. It states
  `only_rules: [no_magic_numbers]` and every option of that rule, so the rule
  owns what it measures.

`--force-exclude` makes swiftlint apply the `excluded:` list to a file named as
a command-line argument. `--no-cache` keeps swiftlint from writing a cache
directory into the workspace.

The scope is `files` because swiftlint reads the paths it is given.

## The project's own `excluded:` list decides which files are read

The `magic-numbers` prompt rule names no carve-out by path, and swiftlint holds
no check of its own that reads a path: `no_magic_numbers` reads no header line
and no file name. A project states which directories the linter passes over in
the `excluded:` list of its own `.swiftlint.yml` — the directory its generator
writes into, and its vendored trees — and that list is the whole path carve-out.

Measured over two files that each hold `return status == 404`, one under
`Generated/` and one under `Sources/`, beside a `.swiftlint.yml` that states
`excluded: [Generated]`:

| the run | findings |
|---|---|
| the shipped script | 1 |
| the same script with `--force-exclude` removed | 2 |
| the same script that never names the project configuration | 2 |

The acceptance test
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_reads_the_project_exclude_list` holds
the run to the 1 finding of the first row.

## A run whose every file the project excludes

`--force-exclude` can leave swiftlint no file to read. swiftlint then exits 1
and writes `Error: No lintable files found at paths: ...` to stderr, which reads
as a broken tool. A change that touched generated code alone would then answer
with a tool error rather than with a clean list.

The script reports nothing and exits 0 for that message. Measured
over one file under `Generated/` beside `excluded: [Generated]`: the run reports
no finding, exits 0, and writes swiftlint's own message to stderr.

A run that reports nothing and exits 0 over a file swiftlint never read is the
clean answer of a run that read every file. So the script states each path of
the run under the `sah-diagnostic:` marker before it exits, and the marked
line reads `magic-numbers-swift judged no file at <path>, so its
literals are unread`. Measured over the same file: no finding, ONE marked
line that names the path, exit 0.

A sound run says nothing on stderr, which is what lets the whole channel carry
the statement. Measured over the same file with no project configuration:
1 entry on stdout and 0 bytes on stderr.

The loop states a path that IS there, because the `[ ! -e "$file" ]` test above
already states a path that holds no file. Measured over `Sources/Absent.swift`
beside the excluded file: 2 marked lines, one for each path, and neither path
stated twice.

The acceptance test
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_answers_zero_when_the_project_excludes_every_file`
holds the run to no finding, and
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_declines_a_run_the_project_excludes_whole`
holds the marked line.

The message names the path and it does not name the cause, so more than one
shape reaches it. The section "A path the run cannot judge" below states each
shape, and states what the script says for a path that holds no file.

## Each stderr reading takes swiftlint's own message, and not a file name

The script reads stderr three times: a test for a project configuration
swiftlint cannot read, a substitution that states each file swiftlint could not
decode, and a test for a run that found no file to lint. swiftlint writes the
PATH of a file into stderr as well, so a reading that takes ALL of stderr
answers the file NAME.

swiftlint writes each message of its own at the START of a line, and it writes
the path echo after `Error: `. Each of the three readings is therefore anchored
on the start of a line, and the decode substitution carries the backtick pair
swiftlint writes around the path as well:

| what the script reads | the line swiftlint writes |
|---|---|
| `^Could not read configuration:` | `Could not read configuration: file Configuration.swift, line 278` |
| ``^Could not read contents of `<path>`$`` | ``Could not read contents of `<path>` `` |
| `^Error: No lintable files found at paths:` | `Error: No lintable files found at paths: '<path>'` |

Measured with swiftlint 0.65.0, over one file that holds
`return status == 404` under `Generated/`, beside a project
`.swiftlint.yml` that states
`excluded: [Generated]`. The file NAME is the one difference between the rows.
The loose script is the earlier shape of this run with each of its three tests
written as a plain `grep -qF` that carries no anchor and no closing punctuation:

| the file name | the loose script | the shipped script |
|---|---|---|
| `Plain.swift` | 0 findings, exit 0 | 0 findings, exit 0, 1 diagnostic |
| `Could not read contents of.swift` | 0 findings, exit 1, the rule's tool-error line | 0 findings, exit 0, 1 diagnostic |
| `Could not read configuration.swift` | 1 finding on a file the project excludes | 0 findings, exit 0, 1 diagnostic |
| `No lintable files found.swift` | 0 findings, exit 0 | 0 findings, exit 0, 1 diagnostic |

Row 2 broke a run that measured correctly. Row 3 made a WRONG FINDING: the
script dropped the project configuration, ran swiftlint a second time without
it, and reported a file the project excludes. Row 4 moved nothing, because the
decode reading stands above that test, and each other broken shape this rule
measures — a version mismatch and a configuration abort — writes no path into
stderr. The anchor holds each reading on swiftlint's own message as well.

Each anchored reading was measured in both directions. These runs still make a
reading answer:

| the run | findings | exit | what the run stated |
|---|---|---|---|
| the Latin-1 file alone | 0 | 0 | the decode diagnostic |
| the Latin-1 file beside one healthy file | 1 | 0 | the decode diagnostic |
| a project file that states `child_config: other.yml` | 1 | 0 | the configuration line |
| a project file of bytes that are not YAML | 1 | 0 | the configuration line |
| one file under `Generated/` beside `excluded: [Generated]` | 0 | 0 | the whole-run decline diagnostic |

One healthy file that holds a finding makes no reading answer: the run reports
1 finding, exits 0, and states nothing.

The acceptance tests
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_measures_a_file_named_for_the_decode_message`
and
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_measures_a_file_named_for_the_configuration_message`
hold rows 2 and 3 of the file-name table to no finding and no tool error.

## A project configuration swiftlint cannot read beside this rule

swiftlint reads the two `--config` paths as one hierarchy, and two shapes of
the project file stop it. Measured over one file that holds
`return status == 404`:

| the project `.swiftlint.yml` | what swiftlint does |
|---|---|
| `child_config: other.yml` | aborts, exit 134, `There's an ambiguity in the child / parent configuration tree` |
| bytes that are not YAML | aborts, exit 134, `Cannot parse YAML file` |

Each abort writes `Could not read configuration: file Configuration.swift, line
278` to stderr, and leaves stdout empty. The script read that as a broken tool
and exited 1. Both shapes are configurations swiftlint reads on its own, so a
project switched the gate off without meaning to.

The script tests stderr for `Could not read configuration:` at the start of a
line, and it then runs a second time with its own configuration alone. The
section "Each stderr reading takes swiftlint's own message, and not a file name"
above states why the test is anchored. The script writes one line to stderr that
names what it dropped, under the `sah-diagnostic:` marker. The run then
measured with settings the project did not ask for, which is one item it could
not judge as the project asked, and `builtin/validators/README.md` states that
channel. The project's `excluded:` list is not read
for that second run. Measured over one file under `Generated/` that holds
`return status == 404`, beside a project file that states
`child_config: other.yml` and `excluded: [Generated]`: the run reports 1
finding and exits 0.

`parent_config:` in the project file is not one of the two shapes. Measured
with `parent_config: other.yml` beside the same file: swiftlint reads both
configurations and exits 0.

The acceptance test
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_measures_beside_a_project_child_config`
holds that behaviour, and
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_declines_a_project_configuration_it_cannot_read`
holds the marked line.

## A project warning threshold, and what the script accepts at status 2

swiftlint counts the warnings of a run against the `warning_threshold:` key of
the project configuration. At that number, and over it, swiftlint adds one
entry of `rule_id: warning_threshold` and error severity to the report, and it
exits 2. Every finding of the run stands on stdout beside that entry.

Measured over one file that holds `return status == 404`:

| the project `.swiftlint.yml` | swiftlint | the script |
|---|---|---|
| no file | exit 0, 1 entry | 1 finding, exit 0 |
| `warning_threshold: 5` | exit 0, 1 entry | 1 finding, exit 0 |
| `warning_threshold: 1` | exit 2, 2 entries | 1 finding, exit 0 |

The script tested `[ "$status" -ne 0 ]`, so it read status 2 as a broken tool.
It then reported 0 findings and exited 1 for the third row, and the engine read
that exit as a broken tool. One line in the project file switched the gate off.
The script now accepts status 2, and the third row keeps the 1 finding of the
first row.

The `jq` filter selects `rule_id == "no_magic_numbers"`, so the
`warning_threshold` entry never becomes a finding.

The status alone does not tell a measured run from a broken run. At status 2
the REPORT tells the two apart: the threshold run writes a JSON array, and the
version-mismatch run writes 0 bytes. The report makes that one distinction. At
status 1 the report is 0 bytes for the clean run beside a project `excluded:`
list, and 0 bytes for the run over the directory `hollow`, which holds no
Swift file. Each status swiftlint 0.65.0 answers with was measured against the
child configuration this script writes:

| what the run is | status | stdout |
|---|---|---|
| a file that holds no literal | 0 | an empty array, 5 bytes |
| one file that holds `return status == 404` | 0 | 1 entry |
| the same file beside `warning_threshold: 1` | 2 | 2 entries |
| the same file beside `swiftlint_version: 99.0.0` | 2 | 0 bytes |
| the same file beside a project `excluded:` that covers it | 1 | 0 bytes |
| one file whose only line is `public func oops( {` | 0 | an empty array, 5 bytes |
| a path that holds no file | 1 | 0 bytes |
| the directory `hollow`, which holds no Swift file | 1 | 0 bytes |
| a `--config` path that holds no file | 134 | 0 bytes |
| a project configuration that holds `child_config:` | 134 | 0 bytes |
| a command-line option that does not exist | 64 | 0 bytes |

Each row that measured states the number of ENTRIES, and no number of bytes.
The JSON reporter writes the absolute path of the file into each entry, so the
byte count of a report that holds an entry moves with the length of that path.
A later run from a different directory gives a different byte count for the same
run, and a byte count in this table would then read as false. The entry count
does not move with the path, and the entry count is what the script reads. A
report of 0 bytes, and an empty array of 5 bytes, carry no path, so those two
counts do not move.

The two runs of status 2 differ in the report. The threshold run wrote 2
entries. The version run wrote 0 bytes and linted no file: swiftlint compares
`swiftlint_version:` with the version it is, and at a difference it writes
`warning: Currently running SwiftLint 0.65.0 but configuration specified
version 99.0.0.` to stderr and stops. Each run that measured wrote a JSON
array, at status 0 or 2. Each other run wrote 0 bytes, at status 1, 134, 64 or
2. A report of 0 bytes does not make a run broken. The run beside a project
`excluded:` that covers the file writes 0 bytes at status 1, and it gives a
clean answer. The guard on each file and the test on stderr separate that run
from a run that broke. The two paragraphs below state each test and its limit.

So the script accepts status 0, and it accepts status 2 only when the report
holds a JSON array of one entry or more. At each other status, and at status 2
with a report of 0 bytes, the script makes one more test, on stderr. Stderr
that holds `Error: No lintable files found at paths:` at the start of a line
exits 0 with no finding, and each other shape exits 1. The section "Each stderr
reading takes swiftlint's own message, and not a file name" above states why the
test is anchored. That branch is how the project's `excluded:` list reaches a
clean answer, and the section "A run whose every file the project excludes"
above states it. Measured with a project `.swiftlint.yml` that states
`excluded: [src]`, over one file under `src/` that holds
`return status == 404`: swiftlint writes `Error: No lintable files found at
paths: 'src/Magic.swift'` to stderr, writes 0 bytes to stdout, and exits 1; the
script reports no finding and exits 0.

The stderr string names the path, and it does not name the reason. Measured
against the child configuration this script writes, 4 shapes each wrote 0
bytes at status 1 with the line `Error: No lintable files found at paths:`: a
project
`excluded: [src]` list over `src/Magic.swift`; the directory `hollow`, which
holds no Swift file; the path `src/Absent.swift`, which holds no file; the
file `src/Notes.txt`, whose name does not end in `.swift`. The script reports
0 findings and exits 0 for each of the 4 shapes, and it states one marked line
for each path of the run. The `[ ! -e "$file" ]` test runs before swiftlint, and
it states the path that holds no file; the branch that reads the stderr message
states each path that IS there. So no path of a run that judged nothing goes
unstated, and no path is stated twice. No reading separates the other 3 shapes
from one another, and the marked line names the path rather than the cause.

The acceptance test
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_stays_clean_over_a_hollow_directory`
holds the run over that directory to no finding and no tool error.

Measured over one file that holds `return status == 404`, beside a project
`.swiftlint.yml` that states `swiftlint_version:`: at `0.65.0` the script
reports 1 finding and exits 0; at `0.64.0`, at `99.0.0` and at `0.1.0` the
script reports 0 findings and exits 1, which the engine reads as a broken
tool. A script that accepted every status 2 reported 0 findings and exited 0
for each of those three values, and the engine read a dirty file as clean.

`warning_threshold:` and a finding of error severity are the two shapes that
make swiftlint exit 2 with a report of one entry or more, and this rule cannot
reach the second. The child states `severity: warning`, and a child block
replaces the parent block whole. Measured with a project configuration that
states `no_magic_numbers:` with `severity: error`, over the same file:
swiftlint exits 0 and writes 1 entry of warning severity. Measured with a child
that states `severity: error` instead: swiftlint exits 2 and writes 1 entry of
error severity.

The acceptance test
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_measures_beside_a_project_warning_threshold`
holds the run to the 1 finding of the third row of the first table. The
acceptance test
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_breaks_beside_a_project_version_mismatch`
holds the run beside `swiftlint_version: 99.0.0` to no finding and one tool
error.

## The rule owns its own options

A project configuration can state options for `no_magic_numbers`. The child's
`no_magic_numbers:` block replaces the parent's block whole, so the project
cannot change what the rule measures. `swiftlint rules no_magic_numbers` names
three options, and the child states each one:

| option | the value the script states |
|---|---|
| `severity` | `warning` |
| `test_parent_classes` | `["QuickSpec", "XCTestCase"]` |
| `allowed_numbers` | `[0, 1, -1, 100]` |

`severity` and `test_parent_classes` are swiftlint's own defaults, written out
so the project cannot change them. Measured over one file holding
`return status == 404`, with no project configuration: the child above reports
1 finding, and a child that states `allowed_numbers` alone reports the same 1
finding.

Measured against a project configuration that states `disabled_rules:
[no_magic_numbers]` and `allowed_numbers: [404]`, over one file holding
`return status == 404`: the run reports 1 finding. The same run with the
`no_magic_numbers:` block removed from the script reports 0. The acceptance test
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_keeps_its_own_allowed_numbers` holds
that pair of counts.

## A run cannot answer zero for a broken tool

swiftlint exits 1 for a file that is not there, and it writes nothing to stdout.
A shell pipeline takes the exit status of its LAST command, and that command was
`jq`, so the earlier pipe exited 0 and reported nothing. That reads exactly like
a clean file.

The script writes swiftlint's report to a file rather than into a pipe, so the
status of swiftlint reaches the gate above. A path the run cannot judge is
another shape, and it is not a broken tool: the section "A path the run cannot
judge" below states each shape, and states the marked line the script writes for
it at exit 0.

`mktemp -d` makes the working directory the script writes the configuration and
the report into, and `trap 'rm -rf "$work"' EXIT` removes it. The trap covers
every way the script leaves: a clean run, a finding, and a failure.

## A path the run cannot judge

A `files`-scope run is handed paths, and the engine reads the work-list rather
than the disk, so a path can reach the run and refuse it. Each way it refuses is
ONE item of a run that judged the other files, and
`builtin/validators/README.md` states the channel: a line opening
`sah-diagnostic:` on stderr, at exit 0.

Measured with swiftlint 0.65.0 against the child configuration this script
writes, over `Sources/Magic.swift`, which holds `return status == 404`, beside
each refusing path:

| the refusing path | status | stdout | stderr |
|---|---|---|---|
| a path that holds no file | 0 | 1 entry | 0 bytes |
| a file whose bytes are not UTF-8 | 0 | 1 entry | ``Could not read contents of `<path>` `` |
| a file with no read permission | 0 | 1 entry | the same decode line |

Each row carries the status and the report of a healthy run, and swiftlint
judged `Magic.swift` in every one of them. The child states `severity: warning`,
so no finding of this rule reaches error severity and swiftlint exits 0 for a
file that holds one. So neither the status nor the report states a refusing
path, and the run holds 1 finding that a nonzero exit would throw away.

swiftlint names the file for rows 2 and 3, and it says NOTHING for row 1.
Measured over the same run with `--quiet` taken off: swiftlint writes
`Linting Swift files at paths Sources/Magic.swift, Sources/Absent.swift`, then
`Linting 'Magic.swift' (1/1)`, and no word of the path it dropped. Row 1
therefore takes a test of the path, and rows 2 and 3 take a reading of
swiftlint's own message:

- `[ ! -e "$file" ]` runs before swiftlint, and it writes
  `sah-diagnostic: magic-numbers-swift found no file at <path>, so its literals
  are unread`.
- The `sed` substitution takes swiftlint's own decode line and writes
  `sah-diagnostic: swiftlint could not read the contents of <path>, so its
  literals are unread`. swiftlint writes the ABSOLUTE path into that line, so
  the marked line carries one.

Measured with the shipped script, each refusing path beside `Magic.swift`: 1
finding on stdout, ONE marked line on stderr, exit 0. Measured over each
refusing path alone: no finding, the same one marked line, exit 0.

`exit 1` is the answer this rule used to give, and it was wrong twice over.
Measured over `Magic.swift` beside each path:

| the refusing path | the earlier shape | the shipped script |
|---|---|---|
| a path that holds no file | 0 findings, exit 1, `magic-numbers-swift cannot read Sources/Absent.swift` | 1 finding, exit 0, 1 diagnostic |
| a file whose bytes are not UTF-8 | 0 findings, exit 1, the rule's tool-error line | 1 finding, exit 0, 1 diagnostic |
| a file with no read permission | 0 findings, exit 1, `magic-numbers-swift cannot read Sources/Forbidden.swift` | 1 finding, exit 0, 1 diagnostic |

Every row of the earlier shape threw the finding away, which is what
`builtin/validators/README.md` refuses: a nonzero exit fails the WHOLE run, so
one unjudged path throws away every finding the run did make.

`[ ! -r "$file" ]` was the earlier test, and it cannot answer all three rows.
Measured against the three staged paths: the test is true for the path that
holds no file and for the file with no read permission, and FALSE for the file
whose bytes are not UTF-8 — the mode lets a reader open that one. So a run gated
on that test alone reads the third file as clean.

swiftlint reads a source file as UTF-8 and as nothing else, which is what makes
rows 2 and 3 one message. A Swift file a person saved in Latin-1, a binary file
under a `.swift` name, and a file whose mode refuses a read each make swiftlint
write ``Could not read contents of `<path>` ``, and swiftlint then lints no line
of that file.

Three acceptance tests hold the three rows, one for each —
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_declines_a_path_that_holds_no_file`,
`..._declines_a_file_it_cannot_decode` and `..._declines_a_file_it_may_not_read`.
Each stages `Sources/Magic.swift` beside the path, and holds the run to
reporting its 1 finding AND to stating one diagnostic that names the path. A run
that lost either half fails them.

The decode substitution is anchored on the start of a line, because swiftlint
writes a path into stderr as well. Measured with swiftlint 0.65.0 over one file
named `Could not read contents of.swift` under `Generated/`, beside a project
`.swiftlint.yml` that states `excluded: [Generated]`: swiftlint writes
`Error: No lintable files found at paths: 'Generated/Could not read contents
of.swift'`, and an earlier test spelled `grep -qF 'Could not read contents of'`
matched that path echo and exited 1 over a run that measured correctly. Measured
with the shipped script over the same run: no finding, 1 diagnostic that names
the file, exit 0.
The section "Each stderr reading takes swiftlint's own message, and not a file
name" above states each row of that measurement.

## A run answers for the files it is given, and for no other

`swiftlint lint` with no path argument walks the whole tree under the working
directory. A `files`-scope script that hands `"$@"` straight to swiftlint
therefore answers for every Swift file under the repository root when the run
carries no file. That answer exits 0, so it reads as a measured result.

The script counts its arguments first. A count of zero exits 0 with no finding.
Measured over a probe tree of two files that each hold `return status == 404`,
with no argument: without the guard the script reported 2 findings and exited 0;
with the guard it reports none and exits 0. The same script over the two files
reports 2. The acceptance test
`the_shipped_swift_magic_numbers_tool_rule_reads_only_the_files_it_is_given`
holds both halves: the run with no argument, and the run over the two files.

## The rule declares no install commands

Homebrew is the supported way to install swiftlint, and it installs the current
version only, so a Homebrew command cannot pin one. Mint can pin one —
`mint install realm/SwiftLint@0.65.0` — but it builds swiftlint from source and
links the result into `~/.mint/bin`, which is not on the path, so the command
cannot make `check_command` pass. The `doctor.fix_hint` states
`brew install swiftlint` instead. `sah doctor` shows that hint as the fix; the
install lifecycle never runs it.

## How to exempt one literal

Selection in the filter is attribution, not exemption: to exempt one literal,
write `// swiftlint:disable:next no_magic_numbers` above it in the code. To
exempt a whole directory, add it to the `excluded:` list of the project's own
`.swiftlint.yml`.
