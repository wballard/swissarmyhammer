# Comprehensive Test Suite and Edge Case Coverage

## Summary

Implement a comprehensive test suite covering all edge cases, integration scenarios, and system reliability requirements for the complete cost tracking system. This ensures production-ready quality and reliability.

## Context

The cost tracking system spans multiple components (data structures, API interception, storage, reporting, aggregation) and must work reliably under all conditions. This step implements exhaustive testing to ensure system reliability and catch edge cases.

## Requirements

### Test Coverage Areas

1. **Complete System Integration**
   - End-to-end cost tracking workflows
   - Multi-component integration validation
   - Cross-system data consistency
   - Failure recovery and resilience

2. **Edge Case Coverage**
   - Boundary conditions and limits
   - Error conditions and recovery
   - Malformed data handling
   - Resource exhaustion scenarios

3. **Reliability and Robustness**
   - Long-running system stability
   - Concurrent operation safety
   - Data consistency under stress
   - Graceful degradation testing

4. **Real-World Scenarios**
   - Production-like workloads
   - Various cost tracking patterns
   - Different configuration combinations
   - Network and system failure simulation

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests** - Component interaction validation
3. **System Tests** - End-to-end workflow validation
4. **Performance Tests** - Load and stress testing
5. **Reliability Tests** - Long-running stability testing
6. **Security Tests** - Data protection and access control
7. **Compatibility Tests** - Version and configuration compatibility

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
- Create: `swissarmyhammer/src/cost/tests/`
- Add: `comprehensive/`, `edge_cases/`, `reliability/`, `integration/`

### Test Infrastructure

```rust
pub struct CostTrackingTestHarness {
    mock_mcp: MockMcpSystem,
    test_storage: TestStorageBackend,
    cost_tracker: CostTracker,
    workflow_executor: MockWorkflowExecutor,
}

pub struct TestScenarioBuilder {
    api_calls: Vec<MockApiCall>,
    configuration: CostTrackingConfig,
    expected_results: ExpectedResults,
}
```

### Edge Case Test Categories

1. **Data Boundary Tests**
   - Zero token counts
   - Maximum token limits
   - Empty API responses
   - Extremely large costs

2. **Error Condition Tests**
   - Network failures during API calls
   - Storage backend failures
   - Configuration corruption
   - Memory exhaustion

3. **Concurrency Tests**
   - Simultaneous cost tracking sessions
   - Race conditions in data updates
   - Deadlock prevention validation
   - Thread safety verification

4. **Configuration Edge Cases**
   - Invalid configuration values
   - Missing configuration files
   - Configuration changes during operation
   - Fallback configuration handling

### Comprehensive Test Scenarios

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_complete_system_workflow_happy_path() {
    // Full end-to-end cost tracking with realistic data
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_api_failure_recovery() {
    // Cost tracking resilience when API calls fail
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_storage_backend_failures() {
    // Graceful handling of storage failures
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_extreme_load_conditions() {
    // System behavior under high load
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_long_running_stability() {
    // Hours-long test for memory leaks and stability
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_concurrent_session_limits() {
    // Maximum concurrent sessions handling
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_data_consistency_under_stress() {
    // Data integrity during high-stress operations
}
```

### Property-Based Testing

Implement property-based tests:
- Cost calculations always positive
- Token counts consistent across calculations
- Data consistency across storage backends
- Session cleanup completeness

### Chaos Engineering Tests

Implement failure injection:
- Random API call failures
- Storage backend interruptions
- Network partitions and timeouts
- Resource limit violations

- Benchmark execution in CI/CD
- Performance regression detection
- Resource usage validation
- Scalability testing

## Testing Requirements

### Test Data Management
