## Code Under Review

Please review the all code in this project with a focus on: {{context}}

## 1. Pattern Consistency Analysis

- **Architectural Patterns**: Does the code follow established patterns in the codebase (MVC, Repository, Factory, etc.)?
- **Naming Conventions**: Are variables, functions, classes, and files named consistently with existing code?
- **Code Organization**: Does file structure and module organization match project conventions?
- **Error Handling**: Is error handling implemented consistently across similar functions?
- **API Design**: Do new endpoints/interfaces follow existing API patterns?

## 2. Code Duplication Detection

- **Exact Duplication**: Identify identical or near-identical code blocks
- **Logic Duplication**: Find similar algorithms or business logic that could be abstracted
- **Configuration Duplication**: Spot repeated constants, magic numbers, or config values
- **Test Duplication**: Identify repeated test setup or assertion patterns
- **Suggest Refactoring**: Recommend specific abstractions (functions, classes, utilities, constants)

## 3. Consistency Violations

- **Formatting & Style**: Flag deviations from project code style (indentation, spacing, etc.)
- **Import/Dependency Patterns**: Ensure consistent module importing and dependency usage
- **Comment Styles**: Check documentation comment consistency
- **Technology Stack**: Verify new dependencies align with existing tech choices

## 4. Quality Improvements

- **Extract Methods**: Suggest breaking down large functions
- **Shared Utilities**: Identify opportunities to create reusable utility functions
- **Constants & Enums**: Recommend extracting magic values to shared constants
- **Type Safety**: Suggest stronger typing where applicable
