//! What every shipped-rule acceptance test shares.
//!
//! A shipped-rule test drives the SHIPPED script over a probe repository and
//! reads what the real tool reports. This module carries the shapes those
//! tests are written in — a planned run, a fail fixture, a staged position
//! set, a staged row set, one path the work-list names, and a run measured
//! with no file beside the same run measured with the files — and the helpers
//! that drive each shape.
//!
//! The tests themselves stand one module per rule family. A family whose rule
//! for one language answers shapes the other languages cannot show stands one
//! module more, named for that language — the Rust dead-code rule reads the
//! cargo report, and the Swift one builds the package's test targets; the
//! function-length family stands one module for each language it drives.
//! Each module then stays small enough for a reviewer, and for the review
//! engine, to read whole. `golangci_cache`, `scope_roster`, `temp_directory`
//! and `zero_argument` are the four
//! modules that are not a rule family: each reads the shipped script of EVERY
//! rule, because the contract it holds is about the set and not about one
//! language. `scope_roster` states which of those set-wide guards reads which
//! rule, and it holds the two scope rosters to the whole set.
