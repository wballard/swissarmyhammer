# API Interception Testing Suite

## Summary

Implement comprehensive testing for the API interception system (steps 000194-000196), ensuring MCP integration, token counting, and workflow cost tracking work together reliably.

## Context

The API interception system consists of multiple integrated components that must work together seamlessly. This step validates the complete interception pipeline from MCP calls through token counting to workflow cost attribution.

## Requirements

### Test Coverage Areas

1. **End-to-End API Interception**
   - Complete flow from workflow action to cost recording
   - MCP protocol integration accuracy
   - Token counting validation
   - Cost calculation verification

2. **Integration Validation**
   - MCP handler cost tracking accuracy
   - Token counting vs API response validation
   - Workflow session association correctness
   - Metrics system integration

3. **Performance and Reliability**
   - API interception overhead measurement
   - Concurrent workflow cost tracking
   - Error resilience and recovery
   - Memory usage under load

4. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Failed API calls cost tracking
   - Malformed API responses
   - Session timeout scenarios
   - Network interruption handling

### Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path Testing**
   - Single workflow with multiple API calls
   - Concurrent workflows with cost tracking
   - Various API call patterns and sizes
   - Complete session lifecycle validation

2. **Error Condition Testing**
   - API failures during cost tracking
   - Token counting errors and fallbacks
   - Session cleanup on workflow failures
   - Configuration-related errors

3. **Performance Testing**
   - High-volume API call scenarios
   - Memory usage with many concurrent sessions
   - CPU overhead of cost tracking
   - Cleanup performance validation

## Implementation Details

### File Location
- Create: `swissarmyhammer/src/cost/integration_tests/api_interception.rs`
- Test helpers: `swissarmyhammer/src/cost/test_utils/mock_mcp.rs`

### Test Infrastructure

1. **Mock MCP System**
   - Simulate Claude API responses with usage data
   - Generate realistic token counts and timings
   - Support error conditions and edge cases
   - Validate API call interception accuracy

2. **Workflow Test Harness**
   - Create test workflows with known cost characteristics
   - Simulate various action types and API patterns
   - Validate cost attribution accuracy
   - Test concurrent workflow execution

3. **Performance Measurement Tools**
   - CPU and memory usage monitoring
   - API interception overhead measurement
   - Session management performance tracking
   - Cleanup efficiency validation

### Key Test Cases

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_end_to_end_cost_interception() {
    // Test complete flow from workflow start to cost reporting
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_concurrent_workflow_cost_tracking() {
    // Test multiple workflows with cost tracking simultaneously
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_api_failure_cost_handling() {
    // Test cost tracking when API calls fail
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_token_counting_accuracy() {
    // Validate token counts against known values
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_performance_overhead() {
    // Measure cost tracking impact on workflow performance
}
```

### Validation Requirements

1. **Accuracy Validation**
   - Compare calculated costs with expected values
   - Verify token counts match API responses
   - Validate session association correctness
   - Check cost attribution accuracy

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Ensure overhead < 50ms per API call (from spec)
   - Validate memory usage stays within limits
   - Check cleanup performance meets requirements
   - Verify concurrent operation efficiency

3. **Reliability Validation**
   - Test error recovery mechanisms
   - Validate graceful degradation
   - Check session cleanup completeness
   - Verify data consistency
