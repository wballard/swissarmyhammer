//! Acceptance tests for the shipped `idioms-swift` tool rule.
//!
//! Each test drives the SHIPPED script over a probe repository and reads what
//! the real `swift format` reported.
//!
//! Three answers stand apart from every other Swift rule of this set, and one
//! test holds each. `swift format lint` writes NINE tags that no key of the
//! configuration can stop, so the script reads the tag off each output line
//! and keeps only a tag its own ALLOWLIST names. A path that holds no file
//! exits 0 and writes NOTHING, so the script tests each path before the tool
//! starts. And a path that names a DIRECTORY costs a shared run every finding
//! it made, so the script hands `swift format` one path for each run.
//!
//! One more test stands apart because of what it protects rather than what it
//! measures. This gate took five bullets out of the Swift prompt rules, and a
//! requirement deleted without a tool that reads it is one the set states
//! nowhere. `the_shipped_swift_idioms_tool_rule_owns_each_bullet_it_took`
//! holds each of the five to being reported by its tool, over Swift written in
//! the SHAPE the bullet named, AND stated by no prompt rule.
