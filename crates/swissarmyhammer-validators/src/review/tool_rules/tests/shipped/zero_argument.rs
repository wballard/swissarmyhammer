//! Coverage guard: each shipped `files`-scope script answers a run that gives
//! it no file at once, with no finding and an exit status of 0.
//!
//! The `run` key of `builtin/validators/README.md` states the three lines of
//! the guard word for word, and it states where they stand. A `files`-scope
//! script judges the files it takes as arguments. Given none, a script that
//! hands `"$@"` straight to its tool hands the tool an empty argument list,
//! and the tool then reads a default target of its own, refuses to start, or
//! breaks the run. The first shape is the worst of the three, because the
//! script exits 0 and the answer reads as a measured result.
//!
//! The PLACE is half of the contract. A guard under the first `mktemp -d`
//! leaves a directory behind. A guard under the first tool call answers after
//! the tool already read the whole tree. A guard under an earlier `exit 0`, a
//! guard in a subshell, a guard in the body of a function nothing calls, and
//! a guard inside a `<<'EOF'` heredoc each never run at all. A guard under
//! `set -- $(find . -name '*.py')` reads a `$#` the script wrote for itself.
//! Each of those scripts holds the three lines, so a guard that reads the
//! text alone answers true for each.
//!
//! Four lists in this file write that split out, and each list reaches an
//! assertion. `SCRIPTS_THAT_MISS_THE_GUARD` and `SCRIPTS_THAT_HOLD_THE_GUARD`
//! write whole scripts, and `the_guard_reads_where_the_three_lines_stand`
//! reads both. `LINES_THAT_RUN` and `LINES_THAT_RUN_NOTHING` write one line at
//! a time, and two tests read both. So each count this module states is read
//! off a list this file holds.
//!
//! One acceptance test for each rule holds that rule alone, and each of those
//! tests is written by hand. A rule that ships with no guard and no test of
//! its own therefore goes green.
//!
//! This module reads the SHIPPED script of each rule instead, so the contract
//! is held for the rules that ship today and for the rules that ship next.
//!
//! EVERY MEASUREMENT THIS MODULE STATES WAS TAKEN WITH THE SHELL THE RULES
//! RUN. [`crate::doctor::run_shell`] spawns `bash -c <script> bash
//! <argument>...`, so each shape below was run that way, with the bash of the
//! machine that wrote this file: 3.2.57(1)-release. The name of the shell is
//! part of the measurement. `/bin/sh` is the same binary here, and it reads a
//! script in POSIX mode, where a `set` line that names no shell option stops
//! the whole run: measured, `set -y` above the guard exits 2 under `sh`, and
//! under `bash` writes `set: -y: invalid option` to stderr and carries on.
