//! Coverage guard: each shipped script that makes a temporary directory
//! names it `work`, removes it, and names `mktemp` for the doctor.
//!
//! The `run` key of `builtin/validators/README.md` states the shape word for
//! word: write `work="$(mktemp -d)"`, then `trap 'rm -rf "$work"' EXIT` under
//! it. A rule that makes a directory and arms no trap leaves one directory
//! behind for each run, and the acceptance test of that one rule cannot see
//! it, because the test reads the findings and not the temporary tree. A rule
//! added later carries the same defect, and every test of every other rule
//! stays green.
//!
//! This module reads the SHIPPED script of each rule instead, so the contract
//! is held for the rules that ship today and for the rules that ship next.
