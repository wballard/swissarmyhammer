# Architecture

SwissArmyHammer is a monorepo producing CLI tools and MCP servers for AI-assisted software engineering. The core domain is a file-backed kanban board engine with YAML-driven schema and a unified command system.

Consult the root `Cargo.toml` for the current workspace members. This document describes the architectural concepts and rules that don't change with every commit.

## 1. Rust Core

### Crate Tier Rules

Crates are organized in dependency tiers. A crate may only depend on crates in the same or lower tier. Check `Cargo.toml` for current membership — these are the *placement rules*:

- **Tier 0 — Leaves**: Zero workspace dependencies. A crate belongs here if it defines a trait, provides a utility, or solves a self-contained problem without importing any sibling crate. Core abstractions like the `Command` trait (`swissarmyhammer-commands`), the `TrackedStore` trait (`swissarmyhammer-store`), and the `Operation` proc macro (`swissarmyhammer-operations`) live here because they define interfaces that higher tiers implement.

- **Tier 1 — Foundation**: Depends only on Tier 0. A crate belongs here if it provides shared infrastructure (types, ID generation, error types, config loading) consumed broadly across the workspace but doesn't define domain semantics.

- **Tier 2 — Schema and Storage**: Depends on Tier 0-1. A crate belongs here if it defines *what* data looks like without knowing *how* it's used. The field/entity schema registry (`swissarmyhammer-fields`), perspective storage (`swissarmyhammer-perspectives`), and code-context index belong here. They declare types and storage but not business rules.

- **Tier 3 — Entity Layer**: Depends on Tier 0-2. A crate belongs here if it provides generic entity I/O — reading, writing, caching, searching entities against a schema. The `Entity` type and `EntityContext` (`swissarmyhammer-entity`) live here. They know about fields and storage but not about kanban boards, tasks, or columns.

- **Tier 4 — Application Libraries**: Depends on anything below. A crate belongs here if it implements domain logic — kanban operations, skill resolution, tree-sitter indexing, web search. These are the "engines" that the CLI programs wire together.

**The key structural constraint**: Application libraries have no knowledge of any specific CLI framework. They are pure domain libraries. The CLI tools are thin wiring layers over the engines.

**LSP client owner — `swissarmyhammer-lsp`**: `swissarmyhammer-lsp` is the single workspace home for the LSP machinery. It owns the wire-level JSON-RPC client (`LspJsonRpcClient`) and its transport seam (`LspTransport`, with an in-memory fake for tests), the `SharedLspClient` handle, the server-spec schema (`OwnedLspServerSpec`/`LspServerConfig`/`LspServerHandle`), and the builtin server registry (`LSP_REGISTRY`, `load_lsp_servers`, `builtin_lsp_yaml_sources`) loaded from `builtin/lsp/*.yaml` — plus the daemon/supervisor lifecycle (`LspDaemon`, `LspSupervisorManager`). **The dependency edge runs `swissarmyhammer-lsp ← swissarmyhammer-code-context`**: code-context depends on `swissarmyhammer-lsp` (not the reverse) and re-exports the moved types so its own consumers compile unchanged. code-context keeps only the *indexing* layer on top of the transport — the free functions that collect document symbols and call-hierarchy edges and persist them to the SQLite index (`collect_and_persist_file_symbols`, `collect_and_persist_call_edges`), which operate over a `&mut LspJsonRpcClient`. `swissarmyhammer-lsp` carries no configuration-source dependency: the daemon's stderr-noise filter is an injected predicate (`LspSupervisorManager::with_stderr_filter`), and `swissarmyhammer-tools` supplies the code-context-config-backed filter when it spawns the supervisor.

**Spatial focus engine — `swissarmyhammer-focus`**: The headless spatial-navigation kernel lives at Tier 0. It owns the focus state machine (per-window focus, layer forest, `last_focused_by_fq` memory) and the snapshot-driven pathfinder; a caller supplies the scope geometry as a `NavSnapshot`. The only pluggable extension trait that survives is `FocusEventSink` for adapter-side event delivery. The kernel knows nothing about kanban tasks, columns, or boards. Its surface is intentionally generic: a pair of distinct branded newtypes — `FullyQualifiedMoniker` (a path through the focus hierarchy that uniquely identifies a scope) and `SegmentMoniker` (a single hierarchy step appended into a parent's path) — plus abstract `Rect`s and `WindowLabel`s. The path-monikers identity model eliminates the duplicate-registration ambiguity that a flat string moniker would otherwise admit. Its only workspace dependency is `swissarmyhammer-common` (for `define_id!`). An adapter translates its host's window events into focus-engine calls and delivers `FocusChangedEvent`s through a `FocusEventSink`; the kanban-specific helper `resolve_focused_column` is the small piece of focus code that *does* know about kanban and stays in `swissarmyhammer-kanban`. This split is what lets the same focus engine drive any future tier-4 application without dragging kanban semantics in.

### Virtual File System and Content Stacking

The `VirtualFileSystem` (`swissarmyhammer-directory`) is a foundational abstraction. It stacks three directory layers with precedence:

```
builtin/    → compiled into the binary (include_dir!)
~/.sah/     → user-level overrides
.sah/       → project-level overrides (or .kanban/, .code-context/, etc.)
```

When loading YAML definitions (commands, fields, entities, views, skills, agents), the VFS discovers files across all three layers and merges them. Project-level overrides win over user-level, which win over builtin. Partial overrides work — you can override a single keybinding in a command without restating the entire definition.

Every configurable subsystem uses this pattern: `DirectoryConfig` trait declares the directory names, and `ManagedDirectory<C>` handles discovery, precedence, and file loading.

### Content Formats

Two file formats are used pervasively:

- **Plain YAML** (`.yaml`): Structured data without a body field. Used for commands, field definitions, entity definitions without markdown content, views, perspectives, and configuration.

- **YAML Frontmatter + Markdown** (`.md`): A YAML block delimited by `---` followed by a markdown body. Used for entities with a `body_field` (tasks, skills, agents), and for skill/agent definitions (SKILL.md, AGENT.md). The frontmatter is structured metadata; the body is free-form content.

Entity storage format is determined by the entity definition's `body_field` property. If present, the entity is `.md` with the named field as the markdown body. If absent, the entity is `.yaml`.

### Change Tracking: JSONL Changelogs and Text Diffs

Every entity type has a companion `.jsonl` changelog file alongside its `.yaml` or `.md` content file. Each line is a JSON object recording one mutation — the operation, timestamp, and the changed fields. This append-only log serves three purposes:

1. **Undo/redo** — the `UndoStack` reads the changelog to reverse or replay operations across entity types.
2. **Conflict resolution** — during git merges, the JSONL log provides a per-field operation history that the custom merge driver (`swissarmyhammer-merge`) uses to resolve conflicts at the field level rather than the file level.
3. **Audit trail** — operations that return `ExecutionResult::Logged` produce a changelog entry; `Unlogged` operations (reads, queries) do not.

For markdown body content, changes are tracked as **text diffs** (via `diffy`) rather than whole-value replacement. This means the changelog records the patch, not the full body, keeping logs compact and merges meaningful even for large markdown documents.

The custom git merge driver handles three file types in `.kanban/`:
- **JSONL** files — line-level union merge (append-only logs merge cleanly)
- **YAML** files — field-level three-way merge
- **Frontmatter+Markdown** files — YAML frontmatter merged field-by-field, markdown body merged as text with conflict markers when necessary

### Liquid Templating

All YAML and frontmatter+markdown files loaded through the VFS support Liquid template syntax. This enables shared partials, conditional content, and variable interpolation across any configuration or content file — commands, field definitions, entity definitions, skills, agents, and any future YAML-driven schema. Template resolution happens at load time; partials are discovered from the same VFS directory stack, so a project-level partial can override a builtin one just like any other file.

### Key Abstractions

#### Context Objects (Blackboard Pattern)

Every subsystem exposes a **Context** struct that bundles its I/O primitives, configuration, and indexes into a single value. Prefer passing a context object over long argument lists.

**Why contexts:**

- **One argument instead of many.** A function that needs storage, field definitions, and validation takes one `&KanbanContext` instead of three separate parameters. When requirements grow the signature stays stable.
- **Blackboard pattern.** Higher-level contexts compose lower-level ones as fields. A consumer receives the top-level context and reaches through it to whatever layer it needs. No need to thread individual pieces through the call stack.
- **Clear ownership.** Each context owns its resources (paths, indexes, caches, locks). Callers don't manage lifetimes of the internals.

**Context hierarchy:**

```
CliContext                     # CLI flags, output format, prompt library
  └─ TemplateContext           # config key/value pairs

KanbanContext                  # .kanban/ root, file locking
  ├─ FieldsContext (Arc)       # field definitions, entity templates, name/ID indexes
  ├─ EntityContext (Arc)       # entity I/O, changelogs, undo stack, validation, compute
  │    └─ FieldsContext (Arc)  # shared — same instance as KanbanContext.fields
  └─ ViewsContext (RwLock)     # view definitions, CRUD, disk persistence

CommandContext                 # scope chain, target, args, UI state
  └─ extensions: HashMap<TypeId, Arc<dyn Any>>
       └─ KanbanContext (Arc)  # injected as a typed extension
```

Contexts at the bottom of the hierarchy (FieldsContext, ViewsContext) are self-contained. Contexts higher up compose them via `Arc` so the same instance is shared without copying.

**Conventions:**

- **Create with `open()` or a builder, not bare constructors.** Most contexts have an async `open()` that loads definitions from disk and builds indexes. Use `new()` only for lightweight/partial initialization (e.g., tests).
- **Compose via `Arc` fields.** When a higher-level context needs a lower-level one, store it as `Arc<T>` so it can be shared across contexts without lifetime gymnastics.
- **Use `with_*` builder methods for optional capabilities.** Attach engines, registries, or configuration after construction rather than requiring everything upfront.
- **Extensions for cross-cutting services.** `CommandContext` uses a `TypeId`-keyed extension map so domain contexts (KanbanContext) can be injected without the command framework knowing about them.

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**

- **Long argument lists.** If a function takes more than 2-3 related parameters, bundle them into a context or introduce a new one.
- **Passing internals instead of the context.** Don't destructure a context to pass its fields individually — pass the context and let the callee reach in.
- **Cloning instead of sharing.** Use `Arc` to share contexts. Cloning a FieldsContext with its indexes is wasteful.
- **Logic in the context.** Contexts provide *access*, not behavior. Business logic belongs in commands and helpers that receive the context.

#### Command

The `Command` trait (`swissarmyhammer-commands`) is the interface for all state-mutating operations in the UI:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Command: Send + Sync {
    fn available(&self, ctx: &CommandContext) -> bool;
    async fn execute(&self, ctx: &CommandContext) -> Result<Value>;
}
```

Commands are registered by string ID (e.g. `"task.add"`) in a flat map. They receive a `CommandContext` containing the scope chain, target moniker, explicit args, UIState, and domain-specific extensions (KanbanContext, EntityContext, StoreContext). The Command trait is defined separately from the kanban engine — it knows nothing about tasks or boards.

Commands are **defined and run in Rust**, but **exposed for invocation** through four surfaces: native menu bar, context menus, the command palette, and occasionally direct button clicks. The YAML command definition controls which surfaces a command appears on via `menu`, `context_menu`, `keys`, and `visible` properties.

#### Operation

The `Operation` trait (`swissarmyhammer-operations`) is for MCP tool definitions. Operations are structs where fields ARE parameters:

```rust
#[operation(verb = "add", noun = "task", description = "Create a new task")]
pub struct AddTask {
    #[param(alias = "name")]
    pub title: String,
    pub column: Option<String>,
}

#[async_trait]
impl Execute<KanbanContext, KanbanError> for AddTask {
    async fn execute(&self, ctx: &KanbanContext) -> ExecutionResult<Value, KanbanError> { ... }
}
```

`ExecutionResult` distinguishes `Logged` (produces an audit trail entry) from `Unlogged` (read-only). The `#[operation]` proc macro generates MCP JSON schema and CLI argument parsing from the struct definition.

#### TrackedStore

Three-layer storage architecture (`swissarmyhammer-store`):

```
TrackedStore (trait)     — domain-specific store (e.g. PerspectiveStore)
  └─ StoreHandle         — adds undo/cache layer
       └─ StoreContext    — coordinates multiple stores with shared UndoStack
```

Each entity type gets its own `TrackedStore` implementation. The `StoreContext` wraps them all with a shared `UndoStack` for cross-entity undo/redo. JSONL changelogs track every mutation for audit and conflict resolution.

#### Entity

A generic bag of fields (`swissarmyhammer-entity`):

```rust
pub struct Entity {
    pub entity_type: String,
    pub id: String,
    pub fields: HashMap<String, Value>,
}
```

Entity IDs come from filenames, not file contents. This makes git diffs clean and merges tractable.

#### UIState

Per-window state tracked in the Rust backend (`swissarmyhammer-commands`) and synced to the frontend via events:

- `keymap_mode`: cua / vim / emacs
- `windows`: per-window state (board_path, inspector_stack, active_view_id, active_perspective_id, geometry)
- `open_boards`, `recent_boards`
- Transient: scope_chain, drag_session, clipboard state, undo/redo availability

Thread-safe via internal `RwLock`. Auto-persists to YAML on every mutation (when loaded from a file path).

### YAML-Driven Schema

Everything declarative is defined in YAML loaded through the VFS. The YAML files are the single source of truth; Rust code and the frontend interpret them at runtime.

**What's defined in YAML**: commands, field definitions, entity definitions, view definitions, perspectives, LSP server specs.

**Command YAML example:**

```yaml
- id: task.add
  name: New Task
  scope: "entity:column"
  undoable: true
  keys:
    cua: Mod+N
    vim: a
  menu:
    path: [Edit]
    group: 1
  context_menu: true
  params:
    - name: column
      from: scope_chain
      entity_type: column
```

The `params[].from` field declares how parameters are resolved: `scope_chain` extracts from the moniker hierarchy, `args` from explicit arguments, `target` from the target moniker.

**Entity YAML example:**

```yaml
name: task
icon: check-square
body_field: body
search_display_field: title
mention_prefix: "^"
commands:
  - id: ui.inspect
    context_menu: true
fields:
  - title
  - tags
  - assignees
```

**Field YAML example:**

```yaml
name: title
type:
  kind: markdown
  single_line: true
editor: markdown
display: text
sort: alphanumeric
width: 300
section: header
```

### Computed Fields and Pseudo-Field Dependencies

Fields with `type.kind: computed` declare a `derive` function that runs after an entity is read. Most derivations only consume other fields on the same entity, but some need inputs that never live in `entity.fields` on disk — the JSONL changelog, filesystem metadata, etc. These inputs are modeled as **pseudo-fields**: reserved names prefixed with `_` that are lazily injected before derivation and stripped immediately after, so they never persist and never reach callers.

**How a computed field opts in.** Declare the pseudo-field in `depends_on` in the field YAML:

```yaml
name: change_count
type:
  kind: computed
  derive: count-changelog
  depends_on:
    - _changelog
```

At read time the entity layer notices the `_`-prefixed dependency, sources the value, writes it into `entity.fields` under that reserved name, runs the derivation, and then removes the reserved key before the entity is returned.

**Currently supported pseudo-fields.** Both are defined and injected by `EntityContext::inject_compute_dependencies` in `swissarmyhammer-entity/src/context.rs`:

- **`_changelog`** — the entity's JSONL changelog as a JSON array. Missing log file resolves to an empty array (`[]`), not an error — a newly created entity with no recorded mutations is a normal state, not a failure.
- **`_file_created`** — RFC 3339 timestamp from the entity file's `Metadata::created()`, falling back to `Metadata::modified()` on platforms or filesystems that don't support btime. Resolves to `Value::Null` when the file is missing or cannot be stat'd — this is a backstop signal, never the primary one, so derivations that depend on it must tolerate `null`.

Both are memoized through `EntityCache` when an `EntityCache` is attached, so list/read calls on a steady-state board don't re-read every task's changelog or re-stat every entity file. The cache invalidates on the mutation paths that would move these values.

**Adding a new pseudo-field.** This is a three-point change in `swissarmyhammer-entity/src/context.rs`:

1. Add a `want_<name>` branch in `inject_compute_dependencies` that reads the new source and inserts the value under `_<name>`.
2. Add `entity.fields.remove("_<name>")` to the strip block in `derive_compute_fields` (immediately after the engine's per-field loop) so the pseudo-field never leaks into persisted output.
3. Update the list in this section of `ARCHITECTURE.md` and in the docstring on `apply_compute_with_query`.

If the new pseudo-field is expensive (disk I/O, syscall), extend `EntityCache::get_or_load_compute_inputs` to memoize it alongside `_changelog` and `_file_created`. Uncached pseudo-fields are fine for cheap, in-memory derivations but cost real time under the `buffer_unordered` fan-out in batch list operations.

### Patterns

- **YAML-as-Schema**: YAML is the single source of truth. Rust provides implementations; the frontend interprets metadata. Adding a new field type means adding a YAML file — the UI renders it automatically.
- **VFS Content Stacking**: All YAML configuration uses the three-layer VFS (builtin → user → project). Any definition can be overridden at the project level without forking defaults.
- **File-Per-Entity Storage**: One file per entity, ID from filename. Git diffs are per-entity, merge conflicts are per-entity, and the `.kanban/` directory IS the board.
- **ULID Identifiers**: All entity IDs use ULIDs, generated monotonically. Time-ordered, collision-free, sort correctly as strings.
- **Fractional Indexing**: Task ordering uses the `Ordinal` type. Inserting between items computes a midpoint string — no renumbering needed.
- **Computed Fields**: Fields with `kind: computed` declare a `derive` function name. The `ComputeEngine` runs these when entities are read, injecting computed values.
- **Atomic File Writes**: Entity writes use temp-file-then-rename. No partial writes visible to watchers or other processes.
- **Leader Election**: Multi-process coordination uses OS file locks and ZMQ pub/sub. The leader owns write access; followers read and receive updates via the bus.

### Computed Fields and Pseudo-Field Dependencies

Computed fields (those with `kind: computed` in their YAML definition) are derived at read time by the `ComputeEngine`. Some derivations need data that isn't stored in the entity's own fields — for example, the JSONL changelog or the file's filesystem creation time. These are supplied through **pseudo-fields**: reserved `_`-prefixed names that `EntityContext` injects into `entity.fields` before derivation and strips out afterward so they are never persisted or returned to callers.

#### How a field opts in

A computed field declares its pseudo-field dependencies in its YAML definition via `depends_on`:

```yaml
name: created
type:
  kind: computed
  derive: derive-created
  depends_on:
    - _changelog
    - _file_created
```

The entity layer checks whether *any* computed field for the entity type declares a given dependency before loading it. If no field in the type needs `_changelog`, the changelog is never read — the injection is lazy per-dependency, not per-entity.

#### Supported pseudo-fields

| Name | Source | Value | Error / missing semantics |
|------|--------|-------|---------------------------|
| `_changelog` | The entity's `.jsonl` changelog file | `Value::Array` of serialized `ChangeEntry` objects | Empty array (`[]`) when the changelog file is missing or unreadable |
| `_file_created` | `Metadata::created()` on the entity's source file, falling back to `Metadata::modified()` when the platform/filesystem doesn't expose btime | `Value::String` — RFC 3339 timestamp | `Value::Null` when the file is missing or cannot be stat'd |

Both values are memoized in the `EntityCache` when one is attached, so repeated reads (e.g. listing 2000 tasks) don't re-read every changelog or re-stat every file.

#### Current consumers

- **`created`** (`derive-created`) — depends on `_changelog` and `_file_created`. Uses the earliest changelog timestamp, falling back to the file creation time.
- **`updated`** (`derive-updated`) — depends on `_changelog`. Uses the latest changelog timestamp.
- **`started`** (`derive-started`) — depends on `_changelog`. Scans changelog for the first move into an active column.
- **`completed`** (`derive-completed`) — depends on `_changelog`. Scans changelog for the move into the terminal column.

#### Adding a new pseudo-field

1. Add a branch in `EntityContext::inject_compute_dependencies` (`swissarmyhammer-entity/src/context.rs`) that checks `any_field_depends_on(owned_defs, "_name")` and inserts the value into `entity.fields`.
2. Add a corresponding `entity.fields.remove("_name")` in the strip block at the end of `EntityContext::derive_compute_fields`.
3. If an `EntityCache` is attached, add a cached loader path in `EntityCache::get_or_load_compute_inputs` alongside the existing `_changelog` / `_file_created` loaders.
4. Update this section with the new name, source, value format, and error semantics.

### Test Isolation

Tests run in parallel by default — `cargo nextest` and multi-threaded `cargo test`. Two kinds of state are shared across every test in a process and will corrupt a parallel run if a test touches them directly:

- **Process-global mutable state** — the current working directory and environment variables (`HOME`, `SWISSARMYHAMMER_SEMANTIC_DB_PATH`, …). There is exactly one of each per process; a test that mutates one races every other test in the binary.
- **The real filesystem** — the developer's actual `$HOME`, the repository working tree, fixed paths and ports. A test that writes there pollutes the machine and collides with its siblings.

**Any test that touches the filesystem, the working directory, or an environment variable must isolate that state.** This is not optional and it is not a per-test judgment call — if the test creates, reads, or writes a file, it isolates.

The isolation primitives live in one place — `swissarmyhammer-common::test_utils` — and are **RAII guards**: each acquires a process-global mutex, mutates the shared state, and restores it on `Drop`, even when the test panics. Hold the guard for the whole test; never mutate the shared state by hand.

| Primitive | Isolates | Use when a test… |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| `IsolatedTestEnvironment` | `HOME` → a temp directory with a mock `.sah/` tree; serialized on the HOME lock. Does **not** change the working directory. | reads or writes anything resolved from `HOME` (`~/.sah/`, user-level config, prompts, issues) |
| `CurrentDirGuard` | the process current directory; serialized on the CWD lock; restores on drop | must run inside a fixture or temp directory — e.g. project-level `.sah/`, `.kanban/`, or `.code-context/` discovery |
| `create_temp_dir()` / `tempfile::TempDir` | a unique scratch directory, deleted on drop | needs to create, read, or write files — put them here, never in the repo tree or `$HOME` |
| `ProcessGuard` | a spawned child process, killed on drop | spawns an MCP server, a CLI, or any other subprocess |
| `acquire_semantic_db_lock()` | the `SWISSARMYHAMMER_SEMANTIC_DB_PATH` environment variable | sets that variable |

When no RAII guard fits — a fixed TCP port, a shared on-disk resource — serialize the test instead with `#[serial_test::serial(<resource-name>)]` so conflicting tests never run concurrently. Name the resource so unrelated serial tests still parallelize.

`IsolatedTestEnvironment` deliberately does **not** change the working directory, so a test that needs both an isolated `HOME` and an isolated CWD composes the two guards. Both guards retry transient filesystem failures and recover from a mutex left poisoned by an earlier panicking test.

**The rule that does not bend:** test-environment problems are fixed in the test, with these guards — never by adding a parameter, a setter, or a "test mode" to production code. If a production type cannot be exercised without reaching real global state, that is a design smell in the production type; fix the seam, do not widen the API.

### Practices

1. **No feature flags.** The Cargo workspace says explicitly: "NEVER add features or feature flags." The only exception is `test-support` for test utilities.
2. **Entity IDs from filenames.** Never store an entity's ID inside the file. The filename IS the ID.
3. **ULID for all new IDs.** Never use UUIDs, auto-increment, or random strings.
4. **Builtin YAML is compiled in.** Changing a builtin YAML file requires recompilation.
5. **Command registration is centralized.** All command impls are registered in one `register_commands()` function. Don't scatter registration.
6. **Isolate test state via RAII.** Any test that touches the filesystem, the working directory, or an environment variable must use the guards in `swissarmyhammer-common::test_utils` (`IsolatedTestEnvironment`, `CurrentDirGuard`, `TempDir`, `ProcessGuard`) or `serial_test` — see **Test Isolation** above. Never touch the real `$HOME` or repo tree, and never add production APIs to fix test environment problems.
7. **`.skills/` is generated.** Never edit files there directly. The source of truth is `builtin/skills/`.

## 2. MCP Architecture

### The McpTool Trait Hierarchy

Every MCP tool must satisfy three trait bounds:

```rust
pub trait McpTool: Doctorable + Initializable + Send + Sync { ... }
```

This means every tool is simultaneously health-checkable, lifecycle-managed, and MCP-callable.

#### Doctorable (health checks)

Defined in `swissarmyhammer-common`. Every component that can be diagnosed implements:

- `name()` / `category()` — identification and grouping
- `run_health_checks()` — returns a list of checks, each `Ok` / `Warning` / `Error` with an optional fix suggestion
- `is_applicable()` — skip checks that don't apply to the current environment

#### Initializable (lifecycle)

Defined in `swissarmyhammer-common`. Every component with setup/teardown needs implements:

- `init(scope)` / `deinit(scope)` — one-time project setup/teardown
- `start()` / `stop()` — runtime lifecycle, called when an MCP client connects/disconnects
- `priority()` — ordering (lower runs first for init, reverse for deinit)
- `is_applicable(scope)` — scope-aware filtering

Three scopes: `Project` (`.sah/`, `.skills/`), `Local` (Claude Code settings), `User` (global config).

#### McpTool (the tool itself)

Defined in `swissarmyhammer-tools`. The core tool interface:

- `name()` — unique identifier, conventionally `{category}_{action}`
- `description()` — typically loaded via `include_str!("description.md")`
- `schema()` — JSON Schema for argument validation
- `execute(arguments, context)` — the actual tool logic
- `operations()` — for operation-based tools, returns the verb/noun operation list

Two convenience macros reduce boilerplate: `impl_default_doctorable!` and `impl_empty_initializable!` for tools that don't need custom health checks or lifecycle. `impl_default_doctorable!` inherits the trait's default OK check so the tool still appears in `sah doctor`.

### Tool Registration and Discovery

Tools are registered into a `ToolRegistry` at server startup. Each tool category has a `register_*_tools()` function. The registry powers:

- **MCP `list_tools`** — returns all enabled tools with schemas
- **MCP `call_tool`** — dispatches to the tool by name
- **CLI subcommands** — the same tools are exposed via dynamic clap generation
- **Doctor** — iterates all tools calling `Doctorable::run_health_checks()`
- **Init/Deinit** — iterates all tools calling `Initializable::init()` / `deinit()`

### Transport

The MCP server supports two transports via the `rmcp` crate:

- **Stdio** (default) — standard input/output, the standard mode for Claude Code integration
- **HTTP** — Streamable HTTP transport for remote or multi-client scenarios

### Operation-Based Tools

Tools that handle multiple verbs on the same noun (like the kanban tool handling "add task", "list tasks", "move task") use the `Operation` trait for forgiving input parsing. The tool's `operations()` method returns the operation list, enabling:

- Automatic JSON schema generation from operation structs
- Dynamic CLI noun-verb subcommand generation
- Verb/noun routing from a single MCP tool entry point

### Patterns

- **McpTool = Doctorable + Initializable + Tool**: Every MCP tool is simultaneously health-checkable, lifecycle-managed, and callable. Enforced by the supertrait bound.
- **Operation = Struct + Execute**: Operations are structs with `#[operation]` proc macro. Fields are parameters. Generates MCP JSON schema and CLI args from the same type.
- **Dynamic CLI from Schema**: CLI programs generate clap command trees from the operation schema. Adding an `#[operation]` struct automatically adds a CLI subcommand.

### Practices

1. **Every tool implements all three traits.** Use `impl_default_doctorable!` / `impl_empty_initializable!` if a tool has no custom health checks or lifecycle, but never skip the traits.
2. **init/deinit runs `Initializable` components in priority order.** Don't add setup logic outside the `Initializable` trait.
3. **Doctor collects from the tool registry.** A tool must not hide health checks outside its `Doctorable` implementation. A library that is not a tool takes the other path: it reports status facts, and the CLI converts them to check rows. See the Doctor Pattern in section 4.

## 3. Agents, LLMs, and Embeddings

### Agent Architecture

Agents run via the Claude CLI. The backend speaks ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) 0.12 — it constructs an `agent_client_protocol::Agent` via its builder, registers typed handlers for incoming requests and notifications, and connects to a transport with `connect_with(...)`. From a consumer's perspective an agent is a process that talks ACP over JSON-RPC 2.0 / stdio.

```
swissarmyhammer-agent (facade)
└── create_agent(ChatModelConfig) builds:

    └── claude-agent — wraps the Claude CLI as a child process
                       translates Claude API responses to/from ACP
```

Consumers call `create_agent(ChatModelConfig)` and receive an `AcpAgentHandle` that carries an in-process ACP client plus a `SessionNotification` broadcast receiver. They never touch the underlying implementation. Claude Code is the only chat executor, so `ChatModelConfig` chooses no backend — it carries only the Claude CLI `--model` switch, read from `model:` / `review.model` in `.sah/sah.yaml`.

### ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)

ACP is the protocol that makes agents interoperable with editors (Zed, JetBrains, etc.) and with each other. It defines:

- **Sessions** — stateful conversations with an agent
- **Prompt turns** — request/response pairs with streaming content blocks
- **Capabilities** — filesystem access, terminal execution, plans, slash commands
- **Permissions** — configurable policies (AlwaysAsk, AutoApproveReads, RuleBased)

The `claude-agent` crate implements ACP over JSON-RPC 2.0 / stdio. It builds its server via `agent_client_protocol::Agent.builder().on_receive_request(...).on_receive_notification(...).connect_with(transport, bridge)` — a single typed handler keyed on `ClientRequest` covers every ACP method (`initialize`, `authenticate`, `session/*`, plus extension channels), and the SDK demuxes by method name. The `acp-conformance` crate provides a protocol conformance test suite that validates any ACP backend against the spec.

**End-of-turn marker.** A client that reassembles a turn's reply from streamed `session/update` chunks needs to know when that stream is finished. The `session/prompt` response does not answer it: notifications travel their own broadcast path (backend channel -> tracing hop -> pool notifier -> per-turn collector), so chunks are still in flight when the response lands. Every agent therefore emits one last notification per turn — an empty `SessionInfoUpdate` carrying `_meta.turn_complete` — built and recognized by `agent-client-protocol-extras::turn_complete`. Every hop is FIFO, so the marker cannot overtake a chunk of its own turn, and a collector that sees it knows the reply is whole. `claude-agent`, the `acp-conformance` mock adapter, and the `PlaybackAgent` replay all emit it; `claude_agent::collect_response_content` and `swissarmyhammer_agent::execute_prompt`'s own `await_collector` both drain on it, with a timeout kept only as a hang guard that reports an error rather than a truncated reply. A turn ends at the marker however it ends: the agent emits it after the turn body, on a single exit path that no `return` or `?` inside the turn can bypass — so a REJECTED prompt on a live session ends that client's collector instead of leaving it to wait out the hang guard. `claude-agent` addresses the marker to the resolved session's canonical id, the same key the turn's chunks carry; when the id did not resolve (unknown session, or an unreadable session store) it addresses the marker to the id the client sent, which is what that client's collector is waiting on. A panic or a dropped `prompt` future is the one way past the emit, and that is why the drain keeps a hang guard at all. `swissarmyhammer-agent` needs no marker emitter of its own: `execute_prompt` only ever drives a `claude_agent::ClaudeAgent` (via `wrap_claude_into_handle`), so the marker that agent already emits reaches its collector over the same broadcast channel, unmodified by the `trace_notifications` forwarding hop in between (^cv5b83m).

It also fires Claude-compatible `.claude/settings.json` hooks at its lifecycle seams: a per-session `HookableAgent` (from `agent-client-protocol-extras`) is built from the session cwd's settings chain and fires `SessionStart` (on `new_session`/`load_session`/`resume_session`), `UserPromptSubmit` (at `prompt` entry, which can block or inject context), and `Stop` (at `prompt` return) hooks. This is a contained extension of the ACP layer, not a new dependency edge. The tool-dispatch seam (`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`) is wired in a separate task.

### Subagent Metadata (not LLM inference)

The agent MCP tool (`swissarmyhammer-agents`) does NOT run LLM inference. It provides **metadata** — agent definitions loaded from AGENT.md files via the VFS — so the host agent (Claude Code or a local LLM) can adopt the persona, instructions, and tool configuration of a specialized subagent. Operations: `list agent`, `use agent`, `search agent`. Agent instructions are rendered through Liquid templates at load time.

### Embedding Architecture

Text embeddings power semantic search across code context and entities. Two backends implement the sealed `TextEmbedder` trait:

- **llama-embedding** — CPU/GPU embedding via llama.cpp with GGUF models
- **ane-embedding** — Apple Neural Engine embedding via CoreML (macOS only)

The `swissarmyhammer-embedding` facade selects the best backend for the current platform automatically. It handles long-text chunking with overlap and mean-pooling transparently. Model resolution goes through `model-loader`, which handles HuggingFace repo downloads and local path resolution with caching.

### Ralph: Persistent Agent Loop

Ralph prevents an autonomous agent from stopping while work remains. Used by skills like `finish` and `test-loop`.

1. A skill calls `set ralph` with an instruction and max_iterations (default 50)
2. Ralph writes a `.ralph/<session_id>.md` file with the instruction and iteration counter
3. When the agent's Stop hook fires, `check ralph` returns `"decision": "block"` if iterations remain
4. Each check increments the counter — the hard ceiling prevents infinite loops
5. When work is done, `clear ralph` releases the block

The iteration counter persists across `set ralph` calls so a skill cannot reset the safety cap.

Session ids on the two sides of this loop can never match: `set ralph` defaults to the MCP server process's session id, while the Stop hook runs `check ralph` in a fresh CLI process and pipes in the harness's session id. Ownership therefore comes from the process tree: `set ralph` records the writing process's pid as `owner_pid` in the instruction file, and on a named-session miss `check ralph` falls back only to an instruction whose owner process is alive and is a proper ancestor of the checker, or is a sibling under a shared proper ancestor (the harness spawned the MCP server and the hook CLI as siblings). An instruction owned by a live peer session never blocks another session, and an instruction whose owner process has ended never blocks anyone — one session's net cannot hold a different session open. `clear ralph` without an explicit `session_id` removes the caller's own state file, or, when there is none, only the state files of ended sessions (dead or missing owner); a live peer's instruction is never removed. `get ralph` without an explicit `session_id` keeps the read-only newest-file fallback for display.

The hook runs `sah tool ralph ralph check --` and strict-parses its stdout, so the ralph tool reports `McpTool::cli_output_is_json` and the CLI prints exactly one JSON document for it. Every other `sah tool` family still prints YAML for a human reader. The hook reader we own (`agent-client-protocol-extras::hook_config`) accepts JSON or YAML from any hook command.

### Patterns

- **ACP as Protocol**: Agent interop uses the Agent Communication Protocol, not ad-hoc APIs. Consumers go through `swissarmyhammer-agent::create_agent` and only ever receive an `AcpAgentHandle` — the ACP transport, not the concrete `claude-agent` implementation, is the contract. In ACP 0.12, backends are built by registering handlers on `Agent.builder()` and wiring them to a transport with `connect_with(...)` — there is no `impl Agent for MyBackend` trait to implement. The conformance test suite validates any new backend.
- **Metadata, Not Inference**: The subagent system provides persona/instructions to the host agent. It does not spawn LLM processes.
- **Platform-Aware Embedding**: The embedding facade selects the best backend (ANE on Apple Silicon, llama.cpp elsewhere) automatically.

### Practices

1. **New agent backends must build their server via `agent_client_protocol::Agent.builder()`.** In ACP 0.12 `Agent` is a unit struct, not a trait — register typed handlers with `.on_receive_request(...)` and `.on_receive_notification(...)`, then call `.connect_with(transport, bridge)` to run the dispatch loop. Don't create separate interfaces and don't try to `impl Agent for ...` (that pattern is the 0.10 contract and no longer exists).
2. **New agent backends must pass `acp-conformance`.** The conformance suite is the contract, not individual test cases.
3. **The `TextEmbedder` trait is sealed.** Only workspace crates can implement it. Don't expose it for external implementation.
4. **Ralph's iteration counter is a safety cap, not a feature.** Skills should `clear ralph` when done, not rely on hitting the ceiling.

## 4. Command Line Programs

The workspace produces several binaries. The specifics change — check `Cargo.toml` for the current list. The architectural patterns are stable:

### Dynamic CLI from Schema

CLI programs generate their clap command trees from the operation/command schema. Adding an `#[operation]` struct automatically adds a CLI subcommand. The CLI always matches the available operations without manual synchronization.

### init/deinit Pattern

CLI programs that integrate with Claude Code provide `init [project|local|user]` and `deinit` subcommands. These run all `Initializable` components in priority order for the given scope — registering the MCP server, creating project structure, deploying builtin skills/agents, and configuring Claude Code settings.

A component covers an install concern the declarative `mirdan::install::Profile` cannot express. `ValidatorTools` is one: it pre-installs the command-line tools the review engine's tool rules need, through `swissarmyhammer_validators::review::install_project_tool_rules`. mirdan is the shared installer for every tool CLI, so it must not depend on the review engine; reading a tool rule's `install.commands` means parsing the validator stack, which only the review engine can do.

### Doctor Pattern

Every CLI has a `doctor` subcommand that prints one diagnostic report of `Check` rows. Checks get into that report by one of two paths.

**`Doctorable` — the component checks itself.** The component implements `Doctorable` and returns its rows from `run_health_checks()`. The doctor reads the `McpTool` registry and collects from every tool. It adds the system-level checks (PATH, file permissions, LSP servers) to make the report. Use this path when the component is in the registry and the check needs only what the component holds.

**Fact producer — the library reports facts and the CLI makes the rows.** A library that more than one surface reads does not implement `Doctorable`. It gives plain status structs and a conversion to `Check` rows:

- The producer function returns a status struct. Facts only — no format, no color, no exit code.
- A conversion function (`to_checks()`, `statuses_to_checks()`) makes the `Check` rows. The filter and the status policy stay in that one function, so every consumer gets the same policy.
- The producer splits into a thin loader and a `_with` core. The loader reads the host — config files, the workspace root, the validator directories. The `_with` core takes those inputs as arguments. Tests drive the `_with` core with synthetic inputs, so they do not depend on what the host has installed.
- The CLI wires the loader into its check list, and turns a load failure into one Error row. A broken library never stops the doctor run.

Two shipped modules use the fact-producer path:

- `mirdan::status` — `check_all_doctored()` reports the install status of each sah-managed component, for each doctor-enabled agent, in each scope. `statuses_to_checks()` makes the rows; it drops the not-applicable rows and applies the scope-pair policy. `mirdan::doctor::MirdanDoctor` and the `commands::doctor::checks` module of `swissarmyhammer-cli` both consume it; the CLI seam is `check_install_stack_with`. The `mirdan status` command reads the same facts with no doctor.
- `swissarmyhammer-validators::doctor` — `check_review_engine()` reports the detected project types, the applicability of each validator set, and the tool presence, tool version, and fixture result of each tool rule. `to_checks()` makes the rows, and `check_review_engine_with()` is the test seam. The `commands::doctor::checks` module of `swissarmyhammer-cli` consumes it.

  Proving a tool rule runs its `run` script against the set's fail and pass fixtures, which for a Rust rule is a real `cargo clippy`. `swissarmyhammer-validators::review::tool_health` stores a PASS at `<workspace>/.sah/tmp/review-tool-health.json`, keyed on the tool version and a digest of the rule's `tool` block and its fixture files. Only a pass is stored, because a fixture run also breaks for environmental reasons; a rule that does not pass is proved again on every run. The file and its directory are created at the moment a verdict is saved and never at open, so a review of a repository that stores nothing leaves that tree as it found it. The review engine reads the stored verdict; doctor never does — it proves every rule and writes what its own run earned, so doctor stays the ground truth and a review that follows reads doctor's own answer. Doctor runs in a process of its own, so the file is all the two share: a rule doctor proves broken loses its stored verdict, and a drop that leaves no verdict standing deletes the file rather than leaving the old pass on the disk.

Use the fact producer when the facts have a consumer other than doctor, or when the owning crate must not depend on the tool registry. Use `Doctorable` in all other cases.

### Practices

1. **The kanban board is the single source of truth for task tracking.** Not markdown files, not built-in task tools.
2. **Verify before claiming.** Always run tests, check logs, read output. Never guess, never ask the user to verify.
