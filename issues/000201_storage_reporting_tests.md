# Storage and Reporting Test Coverage

## Summary

Implement comprehensive test coverage for the storage and reporting components (steps 000198-000200), ensuring cost data storage, markdown formatting, metrics integration, and optional database functionality work reliably together.

## Context

The storage and reporting system integrates cost data with multiple storage backends (markdown files, metrics system, optional database). This step validates the complete storage pipeline and ensures data consistency across all storage mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Test Coverage Areas

1. **Issue Markdown Integration**
   - Cost section generation accuracy
   - Issue completion workflow with cost data
   - Markdown formatting and parsing validation
   - Backward compatibility with existing issues

2. **Metrics System Integration**
   - Cost data integration with workflow metrics
   - Aggregation accuracy and performance
   - Trend calculation validation
   - Statistical analysis correctness

3. **Database Storage Integration**
   - Optional database functionality
   - Data synchronization between storage backends
   - Query accuracy and performance
   - Schema migration and integrity

4. **End-to-End Storage Workflow**
   - Complete cost data flow from capture to storage
   - Multi-backend consistency validation
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Performance under load

### Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path Testing**
   - Complete issue workflow with cost tracking
   - Cost data stored in all configured backends
   - Accurate cost reporting in all formats
   - Consistent data across storage systems

2. **Configuration Testing**
   - Different storage backend configurations
   - Disabled/enabled database storage
   - Various formatting options
   - Configuration change handling

3. **Error Condition Testing**
   - Storage backend failures
   - Partial cost data scenarios
   - Database connection issues
   - Markdown formatting errors

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Large cost datasets
   - Concurrent storage operations
   - Query performance validation
   - Memory usage optimization

}
```

### Validation Requirements

1. **Data Consistency**
   - Same cost data across all storage backends
   - Accurate markdown formatting
   - Correct metrics integration
   - Database query accuracy

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Storage operations within performance requirements
   - Query response times acceptable
   - Memory usage within limits
